      "explanation": "Substantial pediatric enrollment across age groups: 3,721 children ages 9-12 months received Menactra with 997 controls; 1,713 children ages 2-10 years received Menactra vs 1,519 Menomune controls; 2,270 adolescents ages 11-18 years vs 972 controls. These sample sizes provide adequate power to detect common adverse events (occurring at >1% frequency) but may be insufficient for rare serious events."

    "follow_up_duration": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "Active solicited monitoring lasted only 7 days post-vaccination for local and systemic reactions. Unsolicited adverse events monitored for 28-30 days. Serious adverse events and emergency room visits tracked for 6 months via scripted telephone interview. This follow-up period is limited for detecting delayed-onset autoimmune or neurological conditions. The 6-month SAE window relies on passive reporting through phone contact rather than active clinical assessment."
    },
    "comparison_group": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "All primary studies used active comparators rather than true placebo controls. Main comparator was Menomune (meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine) which has its own reactogenicity profile. For infants, controls received routine childhood vaccines without Menactra. This design allows relative safety comparison between vaccines but cannot establish absolute vaccine-attributable risk compared to no intervention. SAE rates ranged from 0.6-1.3% for Menactra vs 0.7-1.3% for Menomune in older children and adults."

    "active_surveillance": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "Participants monitored 20-30 minutes post-vaccination for immediate reactions. Diary cards used for 7-day solicited adverse events. However, 6-month SAE monitoring was conducted via telephone interview, not active clinical surveillance. Unsolicited adverse event information obtained by telephone interview or interim clinic visit. Post-marketing safety relies on voluntary VAERS reporting plus one retrospective cohort study for GBS."

    "neurological_monitoring": {
      "rating": "adequate",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "explanation": "GBS risk specifically evaluated in large post-marketing retrospective cohort study of 9.6 million individuals ages 11-18. Of 72 confirmed GBS cases, none occurred within 42 days of Menactra vaccination. Attributable risk estimated 0-5 cases per million vaccinees. Warning included for persons with prior GBS. Post-marketing reports include GBS, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), transverse myelitis, facial palsy, convulsion, and paraesthesia. Seizures monitored as solicited adverse event (0% in clinical trials)."
    },
    "vulnerable_subgroups": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "Limited safety data for vulnerable populations. Immunocompromised individuals may have reduced immune response but no dedicated safety studies. Complement-deficient patients remain at disease risk even after vaccination. Pregnancy registry exists (222 reports over 11 years with 2 major birth defects and 6 miscarriages among 87 known outcomes) but no controlled studies. No lactation safety data. Not established for infants <9 months or adults >55 years. Chilean site enrolled some participants (22% in one study) but subgroup analysis not detailed."

    "data_transparency": {
      "rating": "adequate",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "explanation": "Comprehensive adverse event tables presenting reaction rates by age group and severity grade with 95% confidence intervals. SAE rates reported by age group and vaccine type. Post-marketing adverse events categorized by system organ class. Key references cited including CDC MMWR report on GBS and Harvard Medical School GBS study. However, complete individual-level trial data not publicly accessible from package insert alone."
    },
    "post_marketing_surveillance": {
      "rating": "adequate",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "explanation": "Active post-marketing surveillance system established. Large retrospective cohort study (9.6 million individuals) specifically evaluated GBS risk. Voluntary adverse event reporting through Sanofi Pasteur (1-800-822-2463) and VAERS encouraged. Post-marketing identified additional serious events not seen in trials: anaphylaxis, GBS, ADEM, transverse myelitis, facial palsy, convulsion, large injection site reactions, extensive limb swelling. Pregnancy registry maintained since 2005."

  "overall": {
    "rating": "adequate",
    "emoji": "✅",
    "summary": "Menactra demonstrates an adequate safety profile based on clinical trials with over 10,000 vaccine recipients and extensive post-marketing surveillance. Common adverse events are well-characterized (injection site reactions in 30-60%, systemic symptoms like headache and fatigue in 25-40%). Key limitations include: (1) no true placebo-controlled trials limiting absolute risk assessment; (2) short active monitoring period of 7 days; (3) limited data on immunocompromised and pregnant populations. Strengths include: large post-marketing GBS study showing no confirmed cases within 42 days of vaccination; comprehensive age-stratified safety data; ongoing pregnancy registry; and robust post-marketing surveillance identifying rare serious events. The GBS warning reflects appropriate precaution despite limited confirmed association."
