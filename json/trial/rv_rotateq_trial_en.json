The trials feature comprehensive statistical analysis with confidence intervals, detailed mortality reporting (52 total deaths with comparable rates between groups), and extensive post-marketing surveillance through PRISM and VAERS. Notable strengths include standardized adverse event collection via vaccination report cards and multi-season efficacy follow-up. Limitations include absence of conflict of interest disclosure, limited data on immunocompromised populations (explicitly excluded), and partial monitoring of autoimmune/neurological conditions beyond seizures and Kawasaki disease. Pre-term infant safety data are available but represent a subset analysis."
