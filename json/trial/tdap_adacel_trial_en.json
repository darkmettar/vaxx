    "summary": "The Adacel package insert documents clinical trials that meet some but not all criteria for robust safety evaluation. Key limitations include: (1) No true placebo control - all comparisons were to another active vaccine (Td), making it impossible to determine true vaccine-attributable adverse event rates; (2) Maximum 6-month follow-up, inadequate for detecting delayed autoimmune/neurological conditions; (3) No pediatric data for children under 10 years as the vaccine is not indicated for this population; (4) Reliance on passive post-marketing surveillance (VAERS) for rare events; (5) No conflict of interest disclosures despite manufacturer-conducted trials; (6) No all-cause mortality reporting. Strengths include randomization, standardized adverse event definitions, separate age group analyses, and active solicitation of reactions during the initial post-vaccination period. The evidence base is primarily designed to demonstrate immunogenicity non-inferiority rather than comprehensively characterize safety."
