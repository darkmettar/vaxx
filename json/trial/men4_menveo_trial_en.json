Strengths include very large pediatric sample sizes (36,146 total subjects), excellent age group stratification, standardized adverse event collection with severity grading, and comprehensive postmarketing surveillance including a 48,899-person observational study. The 6-month safety follow-up and neurological condition monitoring (GBS, ADEM, Bell's palsy, Kawasaki Disease) are appropriate. Key limitations include the use of active comparators rather than true placebo controls, mixed blinding approaches, and absence of conflict of interest disclosures. Statistical methods employed non-inferiority designs with appropriate pre-specified criteria."
