    "summary": "MenQuadfi's clinical trial program demonstrates adequate sample sizes for infants and excellent age-stratified analysis, but has significant methodological limitations for safety assessment. The absence of placebo controls (all active-controlled), undocumented blinding status, and lack of true long-term follow-up (maximum 6 months for SAEs) limit the ability to establish a true baseline adverse event rate and detect rare long-term outcomes. Positive aspects include standardized adverse event grading, active solicited monitoring with diary cards, and intentional inclusion of preterm infants with separate analysis. However, the studies were powered for immunogenicity rather than safety, no DSMB is mentioned, all-cause mortality is not reported, and post-marketing surveillance relies on passive reporting systems. The absence of conflict of interest disclosure and independent funding raises questions about potential industry bias in a program entirely conducted by the manufacturer."
