Strengths include standardized adverse event collection, age-stratified studies, 6-month SAE monitoring, and documented immunogenicity with non-inferiority analyses. Limitations include predominant use of active comparators rather than placebo controls, observer-blinding rather than full double-blinding, absence of all-cause mortality data, and no conflict of interest disclosure. The evidence base supports the approved indications with adequate safety characterization for a booster vaccine."
