    "summary": "This FDA clinical review of Prevnar 20 (PCV20) demonstrates adequate trial methodology for immunogenicity in adults >=18 years with appropriate randomization, blinding, and standardized adverse event capture. However, several significant limitations exist: (1) No true placebo control - PCV13 active comparator used, obscuring true adverse event rates; (2) No pediatric data - vaccine approved only for adults with pediatric studies deferred; (3) Immunocompromised populations explicitly excluded, limiting applicability to highest-risk groups; (4) Only 6 months follow-up, insufficient for detecting delayed autoimmune/neurological effects; (5) No specific neurological monitoring protocols; (6) Entirely manufacturer-sponsored with potential conflicts of interest. The safety profile was comparable to licensed PCV13, but the study design fundamentally cannot establish absolute safety, only relative safety compared to another vaccine."
