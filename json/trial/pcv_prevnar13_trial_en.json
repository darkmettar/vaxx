    "summary": "Prevnar 13 was evaluated in extensive clinical trials with robust sample sizes, particularly for pediatric populations. The adult efficacy trial was a well-designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrating 45.6% efficacy against vaccine-type pneumococcal CAP. Pediatric approval was based primarily on immunological noninferiority to the previously licensed Prevnar vaccine rather than direct efficacy trials. Strengths include comprehensive age stratification, standardized adverse event monitoring, and systematic serious adverse event collection. Limitations include use of active comparator rather than placebo in pediatric studies, lack of conflict of interest disclosures, and limited systematic monitoring for autoimmune conditions. Post-marketing surveillance continues to identify rare adverse events."
