    "summary": "DAPTACEL's safety evidence is based primarily on the Sweden I Efficacy Trial (1992-1995), a randomized, double-blind study of 2,587 infants, with supporting US data from approximately 1,454 additional children. Key methodological strengths include randomization, double-blinding, standardized adverse event definitions, and active short-term monitoring. However, significant limitations exist: DT vaccine rather than true saline placebo was used as comparator (masking potential reactions), follow-up for safety was limited to 6 months maximum, no power calculations for safety outcomes were documented, vulnerable subgroups were excluded rather than studied, and long-term neurological/autoimmune surveillance was absent. The postmarketing section relies on passive voluntary reporting which cannot establish incidence rates. While the document demonstrates DAPTACEL has a more favorable reactogenicity profile than whole-cell pertussis vaccines, the trial design limitations mean rare or delayed adverse events may not have been adequately detected."
