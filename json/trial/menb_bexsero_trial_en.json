    "summary": "The Bexsero clinical development program included 4 main clinical trials with 3,058 subjects aged 10-25 years plus expanded access data on 15,351 university students. The trials employed adequate randomization and observer-blind methodology with standardized adverse event definitions (MedDRA, Brighton criteria). Key limitations include: use of active vaccine comparators (Menveo) rather than true placebo in most studies, limiting ability to determine true adverse event rates; follow-up duration of 6-12 months is minimal for detecting long-term autoimmune/neurological effects; vulnerable populations were excluded rather than studied; and trials were powered for immunogenicity rather than safety. The safety profile showed common reactions (injection site pain 90%, severe pain 20-29%, myalgia, headache) consistent with other adolescent vaccines. SAEs including 2 cases of juvenile arthritis were reviewed but no definitive safety signal identified. Overall, the program meets regulatory standards for accelerated approval but has inherent limitations in detecting rare, delayed adverse events."
