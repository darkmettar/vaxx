Primary efficacy of 96.7% against HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related high-grade lesions was demonstrated. Key limitations include: use of active comparator (qHPV) rather than true placebo which limits absolute safety assessment, exclusion of immunocompromised populations, and numerical imbalances in multiple sclerosis cases (5 vs 2) and spontaneous abortions requiring post-marketing surveillance. The safety profile was generally similar to licensed qHPV with higher injection-site reactions. Comprehensive post-marketing commitments address residual safety questions."
