The pediatric sample size for ages 5-11 (n=3,109) meets the threshold for detecting 1:1,000 adverse events. However, significant limitations exist for pediatric safety assessment: (1) follow-up duration was inadequate at 1.9 months median for children 5-11 and 4-6 months for older participants, far short of the 6-12 month minimum needed to detect autoimmune/neurological complications; (2) the critical myocarditis signal was detected primarily through post-marketing surveillance rather than clinical trials; (3) no all-cause mortality data is provided; (4) immunocompromised children were excluded; (5) no conflict of interest disclosure despite manufacturer-conducted trials. The document explicitly acknowledges 'Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae of myocarditis or pericarditis.' While the vaccine demonstrated strong efficacy (88.2% in children 5-11), the safety evidence has notable gaps that limit confidence in long-term pediatric safety."
