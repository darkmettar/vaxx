    "summary": "The Hiberix clinical program included a reasonably sized randomized controlled trial (Study 1, n=2,963 for HIBERIX) with standardized adverse event collection and documented statistical methodology for immunogenicity. However, significant limitations include: (1) use of active vaccine comparators rather than true placebo controls, (2) very short follow-up period of only 4 days for solicited reactions and 31 days for serious events, (3) open-label design in several supporting studies, (4) no data on vulnerable populations like immunocompromised or premature infants, (5) no reporting of all-cause mortality, and (6) absent conflict of interest disclosures. The postmarketing surveillance section provides additional safety signals but cannot establish causality or frequency. Overall, the evidence base meets minimum regulatory standards but has meaningful gaps for comprehensive safety assessment."
