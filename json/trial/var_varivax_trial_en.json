However, significant limitations exist: the current formulation was not tested in placebo-controlled trials, active safety monitoring was limited to 42 days (inadequate for detecting delayed autoimmune/neurological conditions), vulnerable subgroups were excluded rather than studied, studies were powered for efficacy rather than safety, no independent oversight or conflict of interest disclosures are provided, and all-cause mortality data are not reported. The trial methodology is adequate for demonstrating immunogenicity and short-term tolerability but provides limited evidence for rare, delayed, or serious adverse events, particularly in vulnerable populations."
