Strengths include excellent age stratification, inclusion of vulnerable subgroups, standardized adverse event reporting, and active postmarketing surveillance. However, significant methodological limitations exist: no documented placebo controls, blinding, or randomization in the prescribing information. Safety follow-up was primarily short-term (4 days post-dose). The document lacks mortality data, conflict of interest disclosures, and detailed statistical methodology. Initial FDA approval was 1989 when trial design standards differed from current expectations."
