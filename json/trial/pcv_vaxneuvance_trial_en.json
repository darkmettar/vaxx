Studies used active comparator (Prevnar 13) rather than placebo control, limiting true efficacy/safety assessment vs no intervention. Excellent age stratification and vulnerable subgroup evaluation including preterm infants, sickle cell disease, HIV infection, and transplant recipients. Standardized adverse event monitoring with 6-month serious adverse event follow-up in most studies. Statistical analyses well-specified with noninferiority criteria. Key gaps include absence of placebo control, limited autoimmune/neurological monitoring detail, no all-cause mortality reporting, and no conflict of interest disclosure."
