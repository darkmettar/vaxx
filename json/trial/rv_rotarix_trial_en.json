The study was specifically powered to detect a 10-fold increase in intussusception risk. Key limitations include the narrow age range (infants only), exclusion of vulnerable subgroups (preterm, immunocompromised), lack of systematic neurological/developmental monitoring beyond SAE surveillance, manufacturer sponsorship without explicit COI disclosure, and follow-up duration of approximately 2 years which may miss very late-onset autoimmune conditions. A non-significant numerical imbalance in deaths (56 vs 43) and statistically significant pneumonia mortality signal (16 vs 6 pooled) warrant ongoing post-marketing surveillance. Overall, this represents a rigorous safety evaluation that meets or exceeds typical standards for vaccine licensure studies."
