The vaccine is approved for high-risk children 2 years and older, yet no pediatric clinical trial data is presented in this document. The adult trials demonstrate reasonable methodology (double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled) but are limited by short follow-up duration (14 days primary, 30 weeks maximum), lack of power for safety outcomes, and reliance on passive post-marketing surveillance. While post-marketing data identifies serious neurological events (Guillain-Barre syndrome, febrile convulsions), no systematic long-term safety monitoring was conducted. For parents of children 0-12 years, this document fundamentally fails to demonstrate safety because no children were studied in the clinical trials described."
