Large sample sizes (3,486 in pivotal trial, thousands more across studies) and evaluation across multiple vulnerable subpopulations (Native Americans, genetic risk groups) are strengths. The trial methodology is exemplary for efficacy endpoints. Limitations include short-term safety follow-up (primarily 48-72 hours), absence of all-cause mortality data, limited transparency with some data remaining on file at manufacturer, and no conflict of interest disclosures. Post-marketing surveillance is established through VAERS."
