Key limitations include lack of true placebo controls (all comparisons against another meningococcal vaccine), relatively short active safety monitoring (7 days solicited, 6 months for SAEs via telephone), and absence of mortality data. Strengths include comprehensive age stratification, standardized adverse event collection, post-marketing GBS surveillance study, and transparent statistical analysis. The trials support immunogenicity but the active-comparator design limits absolute safety assessment."
