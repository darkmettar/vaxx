The German household contact study had a physician 'blinded to the vaccination status' but was not a double-blind RCT.",

    "summary": "The INFANRIX package insert documents clinical trials with substantial sample sizes (29,243 infants in primary series, 22,505 in German safety study) and demonstrates efficacy against pertussis (84% efficacy in Italian trial). However, significant methodological limitations exist for safety assessment: (1) No true placebo control - trials used DT or whole-cell DTP as comparators; (2) Extremely short active safety monitoring (4 days for solicited reactions); (3) No systematic long-term monitoring for autoimmune or neurological conditions; (4) No all-cause mortality data reported; (5) Post-marketing surveillance relies on passive reporting systems; (6) No disclosure of conflicts of interest or independent safety oversight. While the vaccine has demonstrated efficacy and shows a better short-term safety profile than whole-cell pertussis vaccines, the evidence base for long-term safety in children is limited by study design choices that prioritize efficacy over comprehensive safety assessment."
