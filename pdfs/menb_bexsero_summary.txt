Introduction

Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., submitted Biologics License Application (BLA)
125546/0 for licensure of Meningococcal Group B Vaccine. The proprietary name is
BEXSERO®. BEXSERO is indicated for active immunization to prevent invasive disease
caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. BEXSERO is intended for intramuscular
injection administered as a two-dose series at least one month apart in individuals 10 through
25 years of age.
BEXSERO is a sterile suspension of three recombinant proteins and meningococcal outer
membrane vesicles (OMV). The recombinant proteins Neisserial adhesin A (NadA),
Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and factor H binding protein (fHbp), are
individually produced in Escherichia coli and purified. The OMV component is produced
from N. meningitidis strain NZ98/254 (expressing outer membrane protein PorA serosubtype
P1.4). The antigens are adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. Each 0.5 mL dose of BEXSERO
is formulated to contain 50 micrograms each of recombinant proteins NadA, NHBA, and
fHbp, 25 micrograms of OMV, 1.5 mg aluminium hydroxide, 3.125 mg sodium chloride,
0.776 mg histidine, and 10 mg sucrose at pH 6.4 – 6.7.
Each pre-filled syringe of BEXSERO delivers a 0.5 ml dose of vaccine. BEXSERO contains
no preservative. BEXSERO should be stored in the refrigerator at 36-46ºF (2-8ºC). The shelflife is 24 months and the date of manufacture is the date of initiation of filling into final
containers.

Background

Invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis, typically meningitis and sepsis, is a serious
condition with high morbidity and mortality, even with optimal medical treatment. Among
survivors, permanent sequelae may include hearing loss, significant neurological damage, limb
amputation, skin scarring, renal failure, and cognitive deficits. While most cases of invasive
meningococcal disease are sporadic, clusters, outbreaks, and prolonged epidemics can occur,
which is unique among bacterial agents causing meningitis. The World Health Organization
estimates that there are 1.2 million cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) and
135,000 related deaths annually caused by all pathogenic serogroups of N. meningitidis (1). In
the United States, most cases of meningococcal disease are sporadic, with an incidence of 0.15
to 0.35 cases per 100,000 population. Serogroup B N. meningitidis is now the most frequently
reported cause of IMD in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
estimates that an average of 402 cases of serogroup B meningococcal disease occurred
annually between 2002 and 2011 (2); in 2012, the estimated serogroup B incidence rate was
0.06/100,000 (3).
N. meningitidis strains are classified based on their capsular polysaccharide into serogroups.
Vaccines composed of serogroup-specific capsular polysaccharides are available to prevent
invasive disease caused by serogroups A, C, Y, and W. Serogroup B polysaccharides, even
when conjugated to immunogenic carrier proteins, are poorly immunogenic. Thus,
meningococcal serogroup B vaccines have been developed that are based on immunogenic
3

outer membrane proteins. Serogroup B OMV vaccines have been used outside the US to
control prolonged outbreaks caused by a single predominant serogroup B N. meningitidis
strain. The immune responses to OMV vaccines are directed primarily to the PorA major outer
membrane protein and are strain-specific. To expand the breadth of the immune response to
encompass antigenically diverse serogroup B strains, BEXSERO includes three recombinant
proteins, in addition to the OMV component that was developed for and used during an
epidemic in New Zealand. The three recombinant proteins are immunogenic bacterial surface
proteins fHbp, NadA and NHBP. fHbp is a virulence factor that contributes to the ability of N.
meningitidis to avoid complement-mediated killing in the host. NadA and NHBP are adhesins.
PorA is a major outer membrane protein that is important for the survival of the bacterium.
All four proteins contribute to the ability of meningococci to survive in the human host and
cause disease. fHbp is less diverse than the PorA protein, but immunologically distinct
variants exist. NadA is expressed by some but not all strains. NHBA is highly conserved. The
recombinant proteins in BEXSERO are based on the most common sequence types of these
antigens identified among endemic disease isolates (4).
While the incidence of meningococcal serogroup B disease in the US is relatively low, recent
outbreaks on college campuses in the US have heightened concerns. Because of the diverse
nature of meningococcal group B strains as well as the low incidence of disease and the
sporadic and unpredictable nature of an outbreak, obtaining data to support effectiveness of a
serogroup B vaccine is challenging. On April 7, 2011, the Vaccines and Related Biological
Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research (CBER), FDA met to discuss approaches to demonstrate effectiveness of
meningococcal serogroup B vaccines. The consensus of the committee was that the primary
mechanism of protection against meningococcal serogroup B disease is complement-mediated
antibody-dependent killing of the bacterium. Thus, serum bactericidal antibody levels induced
by the vaccine, as measured by serum bactericidal activity assays using human complement
(hSBA assays), could be used as a measure of vaccine effectiveness. The committee
acknowledged that the genetic diversity and range of the level of expression of surface proteins
among meningococcal group B strains adds an additional challenge to ascertaining
effectiveness of meningococcal serogroup B vaccines against the diverse population of
circulating meningococcal serogroup B strains.
CBER determined that BEXSERO met the criteria for Breakthrough Therapy designation and
granted that designation on April 1, 2014. Given the public health concerns about
meningococcal serogroup B disease in the US, CBER agreed to consider licensing BEXSERO
under the accelerated approval regulations, 21 CFR 601 Subpart E. The Agency determined
that the accelerated approval pathway was appropriate, basing approval on the ability of the
vaccine to induce bactericidal antibodies, as measured by the hSBA assay, that are able to kill
a panel of meningococcal group B strains that are representative of prevalent strains in the US.
This panel consists of three strains, each of which expresses one antigen (fHbp, NadA, PorA
P1.4) in common with the vaccine components. The breadth of coverage of BEXSERO against
diverse meningococcal group B strains will be confirmed in subsequent clinical studies that
examine the ability of the vaccine to induce bactericidal antibodies against a larger panel of
genetically diverse meningococcal serogroup B strains that represent disease isolates in the
US.

4

During the IND review process for this product, CBER conducted extensive discussions with
the applicant concerning design of clinical studies, appropriate serological end-points, and
clinical serology methodology. The clinical trials supporting the current application were
conducted prior to some of these discussions. Therefore, CBER requested additional analyses
of modified immunogenicity endpoints which were considered more meaningful than those
originally specified in the clinical trial protocols. On July 24, 2014, Novartis Vaccines and
Diagnostics Inc., submitted a BLA for BEXSERO. The established name for this vaccine is
Meningococcal Group B Vaccine.

An (b)(4) potency test (immunogenicity test) is used to assess the potency of the final drug
product. ----(b)(4)-------------------- are tested using (b)(4), and evaluated relative to a
reference vaccine. Performance of the test over time was evaluated. Consistency of lot release
data and the absence of trends indicating changes in the assay or product over time, supported
consistency of manufacturing.
Stability data up to 18 months for the three validation lots of BEXSERO were provided as well
as supporting stability data performed under stressed conditions when stored at (b)(4) and at
(b)(4)---. All data remained within the proposed commercial stability specifications. CBER
determined that the submitted data support a dating period of 24 months.
Among the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) issues that arose and were
resolved during the BLA review were the following: 1) resetting of ------------(b)(4)--------------------------------------------- specifications during OMV Process Validation studies, 2) setting
of specifications outside of manufacturing experience, 3) missing or incomplete filter
validation, 4) drug substance manufacturing process ---(b)(4)----- not validated for worst case
scenario, 5) incomplete information regarding rp287-953 manufacturing process validation, 6)
insufficient information demonstrating control of --(b)(4)-- in rp287-953, 7) missing matrix
reuse validation, 8) insufficient information on control of --------------(b)(4)-------- for drug
substance ----(b)(4)---, 9) incomplete information regarding final container
extractable/leachable (E/L) studies, 10) need for General Safety Test, 11) missing information
regarding aluminum hydroxide manufacturing process, validation and stability, 12) assessment
of the levels of ----(b)(4)---------------- and 13) potency assay optimization. The applicant
supplied the necessary data and information, instituted appropriate tests, or, in certain cases,
provided timelines for submission of supporting data that CBER deemed to be non-critical.

b. CBER Lot Release
The lot release protocol templates were submitted to CBER for review and found to be
acceptable after revisions. Samples from three lots of BEXSERO were submitted in support of
the BLA for lot release testing and were found to be acceptable. For post approval lot release,
the applicant will submit a lot release protocol, samples of final container drug product from
each lot, and samples of each bulk drug substance contained in each lot. Routine Lot Release is
performed by reviewing the submitted Lot Release Protocol and by testing submitted samples.
Confirmatory testing will be performed by CBER according to a lot testing plan developed by
CBER.

ORA, in conjunction with CDER, conducted a PLI of -----------(b)(4)---------------------- from
-----(b)(4)--------------- for quality, facilities & equipment, materials, production, packaging &
labeling, and laboratory operations. At the end of the inspection, a Form FDA 483 with four
observations was issued. Two observations were directly related to Meningococcal Group B
Vaccine operations. Deficiencies were related to sample handling and clean hold time
validation. The firm responded to the observations on October 8, 2014, and the corrective
actions were reviewed and found to be adequate. All inspectional issues are considered to be
satisfactorily resolved.

11

Team Biologics performed a surveillance inspection of the Novartis Bellaria-Rosia
manufacturing facility from June 10 – 18, 2013. All 483 issues were resolved and the
inspection was classified as voluntary action indicated (VAI).
Team Biologics last inspected the Novartis (b)(4) Facility from ---(b)(4)-------. The (b)(4)
facility discontinued the manufacture of all U.S. approved products, and the facility currently
performs only QC testing for U.S. Products, -------(b)(4)----------. The (b)(4) Facility is
included in the Team Biologics Inspection Inventory for GMP Surveillance.
Facility information and data provided in the BLA were reviewed by CBER and found to be
sufficient and acceptable.

d. Environmental Assessment
The BLA included a request for categorical exclusion from an Environmental Assessment
under 21 CFR 25.31(c). The FDA concluded that this request is justified as the manufacturing
of this product will not alter significantly the concentration and distribution of naturally
occurring substances and no extraordinary circumstances exist that would require an
environmental assessment.

4.

Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology

Reports from three toxicologic studies conducted with BEXSERO (and three supportive
toxicologic studies conducted with related formulations) were submitted to provide nonclinical
support for this BLA. In the single and multiple dose intramuscular toxicity study, rabbits
received intramuscular administration of the vaccine once or five times during eight weeks.
The vaccine at the dose equivalent to the absolute human dose or 15 times the human dose on
a body weight basis (4 kg in rabbits and 60 kg in humans) was well tolerated with minimal
effects. Vaccination of the animals was associated with increases in fibrinogen, leukocyte
counts and globulin values that are indicative of inflammation. Increases in creatinine kinase
values suggested skeletal muscle involvement which is likely involved at the injection sites.
All these changes, although treatment-related, were mild and transient. No significant safety
issues were identified.
In the reproductive and developmental toxicity study, five intramuscular administrations of the
vaccine at the equivalent of an absolute human dose or 15 times the human dose on a body
weight basis during pre-mating and gestation periods revealed no significant reproductive and
developmental effects in rabbits. Based on the data derived from these studies, BEXSERO
received a pregnancy category B designation which will be reflected in the Prescribing
Information for BEXSERO under Section 8.1: Pregnancy.

5.

Clinical Pharmacology

Mechanism of Action
Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complementmediated antibody-dependent killing of N. meningitidis. The effectiveness of BEXSERO was
assessed by measuring serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA).

12

NHBA, NadA, fHbp and PorA are proteins on the surface of meningococci and contribute to
the ability of the bacterium to colonize human mucosal surfaces and to avoid host defenses.
Vaccination with BEXSERO leads to the production of antibodies directed against NHBA,
NadA, fHbp, and PorA (present in OMV). The susceptibility of serogroup B meningococci to
complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing following vaccination with BEXSERO is
dependent on the antigenic similarity of the bacterial and vaccine antigens, as well as the
amount of antigen expressed on the surface of the invading meningococci.

6.

Clinical/Statistical

In 2013 and 2014, 13 cases of serogroup B meningococcal disease were reported among
students associated with two US universities, including one fatality. Importantly, the outbreak
at one university extended across two academic years, showing a sustained transmission within
that community. At that time, no vaccine for prevention of serogroup B meningococcal
disease was licensed and available in the US to prevent this serious and life-threatening
condition. Through an expanded access IND submitted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), BEXSERO was used in vaccination campaigns on both campuses. The
urgent public health need for a group B meningococcal vaccine prompted FDA to assess
existing data available from the international clinical development program of BEXSERO, and
determine if those data could support an expedited approval under the accelerated approval
regulations (21 CFR 601.40). These regulations authorize FDA to approve products for a
serious or life-threatening condition upon a determination that the product has an effect on a
surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. For products approved
under accelerated approval, postmarketing confirmatory trials are required to verify and
describe the anticipated clinical benefit. As the result of communications between FDA and
Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., this original Biologics License Application was filed
with data intended to support an accelerated approval.
General Description of Clinical Studies
BEXSERO has been licensed in the EU, Canada and Australia. Data from nine completed
clinical trials, including six randomized trials and one extension study conducted among
adolescents and young adults, were provided in the application. The three main
immunogenicity studies were conducted in Chile, the United Kingdom (UK) and
Canada/Australia. One study, conducted in the US, contributed safety data only, as
immunogenicity was tested using assays that are still under development. In addition, two
small phase I/II studies conducted in Europe contributed safety data (Table 8A). Taken
together, these trials provide safety and immunogenicity data that support accelerated approval
of BEXSERO for use in individuals 10 through 25 years of age. Safety data from the
expanded access IND immunization campaigns, in which serious adverse events were
monitored up to 30 days following the second dose, were submitted to the BLA as interim and
final reports. These were reviewed and further supported the safety assessment of BEXSERO
(Table 8B). Manufacturing consistency was supported by two studies, including a phase III lot
consistency study conducted in European infants (Table 8C).

Vaccine Effectiveness
Evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines for prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease
is challenging. Clinical end-point efficacy studies are not feasible due to low rates of
meningococcal disease. At the VRBPAC meeting held April 7, 2011, the committee
supported the use of hSBA to evaluate effectiveness of protein-based meningococcal B
vaccines. However, antigenic diversity and variable expression of meningococcal surface
proteins, and limitations in methods developed to bridge immunogenicity data generated using
specific strains to a broad range of disease isolates, complicate the approach to extrapolating
effectiveness from immunogenicity.
Through several meetings and multiple communications between the applicant and CBER,
different approaches for evaluating effectiveness were examined. The approach agreed upon
addresses the conditions for accelerated approval by providing data to demonstrate the likely
benefit of the vaccine: a) the vaccine stimulates the production of antigen-specific bactericidal
antibodies; and b) individuals develop an immune response that is active against multiple
strains. Further clinical development post-licensure would provide confirmation that the
vaccine will induce an immune response that is protective against a broad range of diverse
strains responsible for endemic and epidemic meningococcal disease in the US. CBER
determined that the available immunogenicity data from completed clinical trials could be
analyzed using modified immunogenicity end-points that address more definitively the criteria
described above to support accelerated approval. Subsequently, effectiveness will be
evaluated in confirmatory studies that will assess the bactericidal activity of NHBA, fHbp,
NadA, and PorA P1.4 specific antibodies and the effectiveness of BEXSERO against a broad
panel of N. meningitidis serogroup B strains (approximately 100) that have been isolated from
people with invasive disease.

Clinical Immunogenicity Data
In pre-clinical and clinical studies, specific antibody responses were demonstrated to each of
the antigens in BEXSERO: NHBA, fHbp, NadA, and PorA P1.4. To assess effectiveness for
this accelerated approval, bactericidal responses to three of these antigens were evaluated in
individuals 11 through 24 years of age following 2 doses of BEXSERO. Serum bactericidal
antibodies were measured with hSBA assays using three strains selected to measure responses
to one of three vaccine antigens, either fHbp, NadA or PorA P1.4, prevalent among strains in
the US. A suitable strain for quantifying bactericidal activity of NHBA-specific antibodies
was not available. Studies assessed the proportion of subjects who achieved a 4-fold or greater
increase in hSBA titer for each of the three strains (measuring the immunogenicity of the
vaccine components), and the proportion of subjects with a titer greater than or equal to the
lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay for all three strains (composite response used
to show the proportion of vaccinees with quantifiable serum bactericidal antibodies to all three
indicator strains). The LLOQ was defined as the lowest amount of the antibody in a sample
that can be reliably quantified.
In a clinical trial conducted in Canada and Australia, adolescents 11 through 17 years of age
received two doses of BEXSERO one month apart. The hSBA responses one month after the
second dose are shown in Table 9.

BEXSERO was immunogenic in both study populations. The immunogenicity data presented
above are from different studies and were generated in two different laboratories: the ---(b)(4)-------------- (Canada/Australia) and the -----------(b)(4)--------------------- (UK), however they
suggest that the two populations differ in baseline sero-positivity to the serogroup B strains
tested. Higher baseline titers were also observed in Chilean adolescents 11 through 17 years
of age indicating that population differences besides age affect both baseline titers and hSBA
responses. Across three trials, the composite hSBA immune response one month after the
second dose was 63% to 94% (studies in Canada/Australia, and Chile respectively) and in the
UK, the composite response eleven months after the second dose remained significantly above
baseline. These immunogenicity data support that effectiveness providing clinical benefit is
likely in individuals 10 to 25 years of age following vaccination with two doses of BEXSERO
at least one month apart.

Clinical Serology Assays
The benefit of the vaccine is based on the ability of the vaccine to induce serum bactericidal
antibody responses as measured by an hSBA assay. The methodology, performance and
quality of the hSBA assays used for the clinical studies in this application were supported with
detailed methodologies and validation reports. The assays were found to perform adequately
for their intended use.
Bioresearch Monitoring
The CBER Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) Branch issued six high-priority foreign
inspections for three pivotal trials in support of this BLA. The inspections of one study,
V72P10, contributed to the Agency requesting that the Sponsor revise its reactogenicity rates.
The inspections for two other pivotal studies, V72_29 and V72_41, did not reveal significant
problems that impact the data submitted in this application.
Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA)
In accordance with PREA, the requirement for studies in children ages 0 to less than 6 weeks
was waived because use of BEXSERO in this age group does not represent a meaningful
therapeutic benefit over initiating vaccination at 6 weeks of age and BEXSERO is not likely to
be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients in this group.
Studies in children ages 6 weeks to <10 years were deferred because the product was ready for
regulatory approval for use in adolescents and young adults before studies in children age 6
weeks to <10 years were completed. The requirement for studies in children 10 to <17 years
of age was fulfilled by studies in this application.

Safety

Safety of BEXSERO
The safety of BEXSERO was evaluated in 3,139 subjects enrolled in randomized clinical trials
conducted in Canada, Australia, UK, Chile, US, Poland, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy.
These subjects received at least one dose of BEXSERO and provided post-vaccination safety
data. Additional serious adverse event safety data from 15,351 BEXSERO recipients who
participated in vaccination campaigns sponsored by the CDC at two US universities were
reviewed.
Revised analyses of local and systemic reactogenicity rates for the four main trials were
requested to address FDA (BIMO) inspection findings and patterns of solicited reaction data in
the BLA suggesting that data was not obtained solely from source documents. The revised
reactogenicity rates were similar to the original analyses and demonstrated that the overall
reactogenicity findings were similar across studies.
Common adverse reactions across trials included injection site pain, injection site erythema,
myalgia, malaise, and headache. Unsolicited adverse events that were reported among at least
2% of participants and were more frequently reported in BEXSERO recipients than in control
recipients were injection site pain, headache, and injection site induration unresolved within 7
days, and nasopharyngitis.

18

In the clinical trials, serious adverse events were rare following BEXSERO vaccination and
had etiologies unrelated to vaccination. Juvenile arthritis was reported ~5-6 months following
the last vaccination in two study participants, one of whom had symptoms that predated
vaccination. One case of acute thyroiditis was reported ~ 3 weeks following last vaccination;
this subject also has symptoms consistent with this diagnosis that began before vaccination.
One case of anaphylaxis was reported in the CDC vaccination campaigns which occurred
within 30 minutes of the first BEXSERO vaccination, and was considered related to
vaccination by both the investigator and the reviewer. There were no additional cases of
anaphylaxis related to vaccination in the clinical trials evaluated as part of this BLA.
The safety data submitted indicate that local and systemic reactogenicity is common, and the
observed frequency and severity following immunization with BEXSERO was greater than
that seen following administration of a control or comparator vaccines. In the majority of
individuals, local and systemic symptoms were mild and resolved. The type of unsolicited and
severe adverse events reported in subjects 10 through 25 years of age were consistent with
events commonly observed in adolescents and young adults in the US, and the one case of
anaphylaxis, considered related to vaccination, did not occur at a frequency greater than that
seen following other immunizations administered to this age group.
Subgroup Demographic Analyses
The observed rates of adverse events across different demographic groups based on race,
gender, and age were fairly comparable and consistent with overall safety findings.
Concomitant vaccination
Data are not available to establish the safety and immunogenicity of concomitant
administration of BEXSERO with recommended adolescent vaccines.
The applicant has committed to submit the clinical study report from a safety and
immunogenicity study to assess concomitant use of BEXSERO with a second dose of
Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, and W-135) Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM197 Conjugate
vaccine in persons 16 years through18 years of age.

Advisory Committee Meeting

An advisory committee meeting was not convened during the review of this original BLA. A
VRBPAC meeting was held April 7, 2011, to discuss approaches to demonstrate effectiveness
of meningococcal serogroup B vaccines. At this meeting, the committee concluded that serum
bactericidal antibody levels induced by a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine as measured by
hSBA assays are an appropriate measure of vaccine effectiveness. The committee agreed that
genetic diversity and range of the level of expression of surface proteins among
meningococcal group B strains adds an additional challenge to ascertaining effectiveness of
meningococcal group B vaccines, such as BEXSERO, against the diverse population of
circulating serogroup B strains. The committee discussed possible strategies for assessing
breadth of coverage of a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine. Novartis will further address
breadth of coverage as part of their confirmatory studies.
