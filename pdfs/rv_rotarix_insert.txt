FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
1

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ROTARIX is indicated for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1 and non-G1
types (G3, G4, and G9) when administered as a 2-dose series [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].
ROTARIX is approved for use in infants 6 weeks and up to 24 weeks of age.
2

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For oral use only.
2.1

ROTARIX Presentations

ROTARIX is supplied in two presentations, a vial and oral dosing applicator presentation and an
oral dosing applicator only presentation.
Vial and Oral Dosing Applicator Presentation
The vial contains the lyophilized vaccine component, and the oral dosing applicator contains the
diluent. The contents of the vial must be reconstituted with the diluent to form ROTARIX prior
to administration.
Oral Dosing Applicator Only Presentation
The oral dosing applicator only presentation contains ROTARIX and does NOT require
reconstitution or dilution before use.
2.2

Preparation and Administration

Vial and Oral Dosing Applicator Presentation
Use accompanying diluent to reconstitute the lyophilized vaccine component to form ROTARIX.
After reconstitution, each dose of 1 mL is administered orally.
See Figure 1 for preparation and administration steps.

For oral administration only. Have the infant
seated in a reclining position. Place the oral
dosing applicator towards the inner cheek.
Administer the entire contents of the oral dosing
applicator into the infant’s mouth.
Oral Dosing Applicator Only Presentation
The ROTARIX oral dosing applicator only presentation does NOT require reconstitution or
dilution before use. Each dose of 1.5 mL is administered orally.
See Figure 2 for preparation and administration steps.

For oral administration only. Have the infant
seated in a reclining position. Place the oral
dosing applicator towards the inner cheek.
Administer the entire contents of the oral
dosing applicator into the infant’s mouth.
2.3

Dosing and Schedule

The vaccination series consists of two doses administered orally. The first dose should be
administered to infants beginning at 6 weeks of age. There should be an interval of at least 4
weeks between the first and second dose. The 2-dose series should be completed by 24 weeks of
age.
Safety and effectiveness have not been evaluated if ROTARIX were administered for the first
dose and another rotavirus vaccine were administered for the second dose or vice versa.
In the event that the infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single
replacement dose may be considered at the same vaccination visit.
2.4

Infant Feeding

Breastfeeding was permitted in clinical studies. There was no evidence to suggest that
breastfeeding reduced the protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis afforded by ROTARIX.
There are no restrictions on the infant’s liquid consumption, including breast milk, either before
or after vaccination with ROTARIX.
3

DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS

Suspension for oral use
• Vial and oral dosing applicator presentation: after reconstitution a single dose is 1 mL.
• Oral dosing applicator only presentation: a single dose is 1.5 mL.

4

CONTRAINDICATIONS

4.1

Hypersensitivity

A demonstrated history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine.
Infants who develop symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of
ROTARIX should not receive further doses of ROTARIX.
4.2

Gastrointestinal Tract Congenital Malformation

Infants with a history of uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (such
as Meckel’s diverticulum) that would predispose the infant for intussusception should not receive
ROTARIX.
4.3

History of Intussusception

Infants with a history of intussusception should not receive ROTARIX [see Warnings and
Precautions (5.5)]. In postmarketing experience, intussusception resulting in death following a
second dose has been reported following a history of intussusception after the first dose [see
Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
4.4

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease

Infants with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) should not receive
ROTARIX. Postmarketing reports of gastroenteritis, including severe diarrhea and prolonged
shedding of vaccine virus, have been reported in infants who were administered live, oral
rotavirus vaccines and later identified as having SCID [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
5

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1

Latex

The tip caps of the prefilled oral dosing applicators contain natural rubber latex which may cause
allergic reactions.
5.2

Gastrointestinal Disorders

Administration of ROTARIX should be delayed in infants suffering from acute diarrhea or
vomiting.
Safety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants with chronic gastrointestinal disorders have not
been evaluated. [See Contraindications (4.2).]
5.3

Altered Immunocompetence

Safety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants with known primary or secondary
immunodeficiencies, including infants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infants on
immunosuppressive therapy, or infants with malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or
lymphatic system have not been established.
6

5.4

Shedding and Transmission

Rotavirus shedding in stool occurs after vaccination with peak excretion occurring around Day 7
after Dose 1.
One clinical trial demonstrated that vaccinees transmit vaccine virus to healthy seronegative
contacts [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].
The potential for transmission of vaccine virus following vaccination should be weighed against
the possibility of acquiring and transmitting natural rotavirus. Caution is advised when
considering whether to administer ROTARIX to individuals with immunodeficient close
contacts, such as individuals with malignancies, primary immunodeficiency or receiving
immunosuppressive therapy.
5.5

Intussusception

Following administration of a previously licensed oral live rhesus rotavirus-based vaccine, an
increased risk of intussusception was observed.1 The risk of intussusception with ROTARIX was
evaluated in a pre-licensure randomized, placebo-controlled safety study (including 63,225
infants) conducted in Latin America and Finland. No increased risk of intussusception was
observed in this clinical trial following administration of ROTARIX when compared with
placebo. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).]
In a postmarketing, observational study conducted in Mexico, cases of intussusception were
observed in temporal association within 31 days following the first dose of ROTARIX, with a
clustering of cases in the first 7 days. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).]
Other postmarketing observational studies conducted in Brazil and Australia also suggest an
increased risk of intussusception within the first 7 days following the second dose of
ROTARIX.2,3 [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).]
In worldwide passive postmarketing surveillance, cases of intussusception have been reported in
temporal association with ROTARIX [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
5.6

Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

Safety and effectiveness of ROTARIX when administered after exposure to rotavirus have not
been evaluated.
6

ADVERSE REACTIONS

6.1

Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates
observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical
trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

7

There are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation (supplied in a
vial and oral dosing applicator presentation) and a liquid formulation (supplied in an oral dosing
applicator only presentation) [see Description (11)]. Safety data accrued with each formulation
is relevant to the other because each contains the same live, attenuated rotavirus strain and is
manufactured using a similar process.
Common (≥5%) solicited adverse reactions included fussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose,
fever, loss of appetite, and vomiting.
Solicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), and cases
of intussusception were collected in 7 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 7; NCT00729001,
NCT00385320, NCT00429481, NCT00757770, NCT00140686, NCT00169455,
NCT00137930). Cases of intussusception and SAEs were collected in an additional large safety
study (Study 8; NCT00140673) that compared ROTARIX (reconstituted lyophilized
formulation) to placebo. Solicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and SAEs were
collected in 3 clinical studies (Studies 9 to 11; NCT02914184, NCT03207750, NCT03954743)
that compared the two ROTARIX formulations.
Clinical Trials Experience with ROTARIX (Reconstituted Lyophilized Formulation)
Studies 1 to 8 evaluated a total of 71,209 infants who received ROTARIX (n = 36,755) or
placebo (n = 34,454). The racial distribution for these studies was as follows: Hispanic 73.4%,
White 16.2%, Black 1.0%, and other 9.4%; 51% were male.
Solicited Adverse Reactions: In 7 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 7), detailed safety information
was collected by parents/guardians for 8 consecutive days following vaccination with ROTARIX
(i.e., day of vaccination and the next 7 days). A diary card was completed to record
fussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose, the infant’s temperature, loss of appetite, vomiting, or
diarrhea on a daily basis during the first week following each dose of ROTARIX or placebo.
Adverse reactions among recipients of ROTARIX and placebo occurred at similar rates
(Table 1).

Unsolicited Adverse Reactions: Infants were monitored for unsolicited serious and non-SAEs
that occurred in the 31-day period following vaccination in 7 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 7).
The following adverse reactions occurred at a statistically higher incidence (95% Confidence
Interval [CI] of Relative Risk [RR] excluding 1) among recipients of ROTARIX (n = 5,082) as
compared with placebo recipients (n = 2,902): irritability (ROTARIX 11.4%, placebo 8.7%) and
flatulence (ROTARIX 2.2%, placebo 1.3%).
Serious Adverse Reactions: Infants were monitored for SAEs that occurred in the 31-day period
following vaccination in 8 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 8). Serious adverse reactions occurred in
1.7% of recipients of ROTARIX (n = 36,755) as compared with 1.9% of placebo recipients
(n = 34,454). Among placebo recipients, diarrhea (placebo 0.07%, ROTARIX 0.02%),
dehydration (placebo 0.06%, ROTARIX 0.02%), and gastroenteritis (placebo 0.3%, ROTARIX
0.2%) occurred at a statistically higher incidence (95% CI of RR excluding 1) as compared with
recipients of ROTARIX.
Deaths: During the entire course of 8 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 8), there were 68 (0.19%)
deaths following administration of ROTARIX (n = 36,755) and 50 (0.15%) deaths following
placebo administration (n = 34,454). The most commonly reported cause of death following
vaccination was pneumonia, which was observed in 19 (0.05%) recipients of ROTARIX and 10
(0.03%) placebo recipients (RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 0.76, 4.23).

Intussusception: In a controlled safety study (Study 8) conducted in Latin America and Finland,
the risk of intussusception was evaluated in 63,225 infants (31,673 received ROTARIX and
31,552 received placebo). Infants were monitored by active surveillance including independent,
complementary methods (prospective hospital surveillance and parent reporting at scheduled
study visits) to identify potential cases of intussusception within 31 days after vaccination and, in
a subset of 20,169 infants (10,159 received ROTARIX and 10,010 received placebo), up to one
year after the first dose.
No increased risk of intussusception following administration of ROTARIX was observed within
a 31-day period following any dose, and rates were comparable to the placebo group after a
median of 100 days (Table 2). In a subset of 20,169 infants (10,159 received ROTARIX and
10,010 received placebo) followed up to one year after Dose 1, there were 4 cases of
intussusception with ROTARIX compared with 14 cases of intussusception with placebo (RR:
0.28 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.81]). All of the infants who developed intussusception recovered without
sequelae.

Kawasaki Disease – Results from Controlled and Uncontrolled Clinical Studies: Kawasaki
disease has been reported in 18 (0.035%) recipients of ROTARIX and 9 (0.021%) placebo
recipients from 16 completed or ongoing clinical trials (Studies 1 to 8; Studies 12 to 14,
NCT00425737, NCT00346892, NCT00139347; Studies 15 to 17, NCT00197210 for the 3
studies; Studies 18 and 19, NCT00334607, NCT00382772). Of the 27 cases, 5 occurred
following ROTARIX in clinical trials that were either not placebo-controlled or 1:1 randomized.
In placebo-controlled trials, Kawasaki disease was reported in 17 recipients of ROTARIX and 9
placebo recipients (RR: 1.71 [95% CI: 0.71, 4.38]). Three of the 27 cases were reported within
30 days post-vaccination: 2 cases (ROTARIX = 1, placebo = 1) were from placebo-controlled
trials (RR: 1.00 [95% CI: 0.01, 78.35]) and one case following ROTARIX was from a non–
placebo-controlled trial. Among recipients of ROTARIX, the time of onset after study dose
ranged 3 days to 19 months.
Clinical Trials Comparing the Two ROTARIX Formulations
The safety of the ROTARIX liquid formulation was evaluated in 3 randomized clinical studies
(Studies 9 to 11). A total of 4,223 infants received ROTARIX (liquid formulation, n = 2,507;
reconstituted lyophilized formulation, n = 1,716). The racial distribution for these 3 studies was
as follows: Asian 24.4%, White 63.2%, Black or African American 5.1%, and other 7.3%; 49.7%
were male.
In Study 10, a concomitant vaccine administration study conducted in United States, 1,272
infants received ROTARIX (liquid formulation, n = 632; reconstituted lyophilized formulation,
n = 640). The racial distribution for this study was as follows: Asian 3.3%, White 73.8%, Black
or African American 11.9%, and other 10.9%; 51.5% were male.
In Studies 9 to 11, solicited general adverse reactions (cough/runny nose, diarrhea, fever,
irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite and vomiting) were recorded by the parent on diary cards
during the 8 days after each vaccination (day of vaccination and 7 following days). Unsolicited
adverse events were assessed within 31 days following each vaccination (day of vaccination and
30 following days). SAEs were assessed through 6 months after the last dose.
Solicited Adverse Reactions: In Study 10, solicited adverse reactions among recipients of the two
ROTARIX formulations are presented in the Table 4:

Unsolicited Adverse Events: Infants were monitored for unsolicited serious and non-SAEs that
occurred in the 31-day period following vaccination in Studies 9 to 11. There were no notable
differences in the occurrence and frequency of unsolicited adverse events between the groups.
Serious Adverse Events: During the entire course of Studies 9 to 11, SAEs occurred in 4.7% of
recipients of ROTARIX liquid formulation (n = 2,507) as compared with 4.4% of ROTARIX
reconstituted lyophilized formulation recipients (n = 1,716).
12

During the entire course of Studies 9 to 11, there was 1 fatal SAE (with diagnosis of sudden
infant death syndrome) following administration of ROTARIX liquid formulation (Study 10).
The SAE was assessed as not causally related to the vaccination.
Among participants in Studies 9 to 11, 2 intussusception cases were reported. One subject from
Study 10 experienced intussusception 8 days after receiving the second dose of ROTARIX
(reconstituted lyophilized formulation). The event was considered possibly related to ROTARIX.
One subject from Study 9 experienced intussusception 133 days after receiving the second dose
of ROTARIX (liquid formulation); the event was not considered related to ROTARIX. Both
subjects were hospitalized, and the outcome of intussusception was reported as resolved.
6.2

Postmarketing Experience

The temporal association between vaccination with ROTARIX and intussusception was
evaluated in a hospital-based active surveillance study that identified infants with intussusception
at participating hospitals in Mexico. Using a self-controlled case series method,4 the incidence of
intussusception during the first 7 days after receipt of ROTARIX and during the 31-day period
after receipt of ROTARIX was compared with a control period. The control period was from
birth to one year, excluding the pre-defined risk period (first 7 days or first 31 days postvaccination, respectively).
Over a 2-year period, the participating hospitals provided health services to approximately
1 million infants under 1 year of age. Among 750 infants with intussusception, the relative
incidence of intussusception in the 31-day period after the first dose of ROTARIX compared
with the control period was 1.96 (95.5% CI: 1.46, 2.63)]; the relative incidence of
intussusception in the first 7 days after the first dose of ROTARIX compared with the control
period was 6.07 (95.5% CI: 4.20, 8.63).
The Mexico study did not take into account all medical conditions that may predispose infants to
intussusception. The results may not be generalizable to U.S. infants who have a lower
background rate of intussusception than Mexican infants. However, if a temporal increase in the
risk for intussusception following ROTARIX similar in magnitude to that observed in the
Mexico study does exist in U.S. infants, it is estimated that approximately 1 to 3 additional cases
of intussusception hospitalizations would occur per 100,000 vaccinated infants in the U.S. within
7 days following the first dose of ROTARIX. In the first year of life, the background rate of
intussusception hospitalizations in the U.S. has been estimated to be approximately 34 per
100,000 infants.5
Other postmarketing observational studies conducted in Brazil and Australia also suggest an
increased risk of intussusception within the first 7 days following the second dose of
ROTARIX.2,3
Worldwide passive postmarketing surveillance data suggest that most cases of intussusception
reported following ROTARIX occur in the 7-day period after the first dose.
13

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ROTARIX.
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not
always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to
vaccination.
Gastrointestinal Disorders
Intussusception (including death), recurrent intussusception (including death), hematochezia,
gastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedding in infants with SCID.
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1

Immunosuppressive Therapies

Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic
drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune
response to ROTARIX. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).]

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.4

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants younger than 6 weeks or older than 24 weeks of
age have not been evaluated.
The effectiveness of ROTARIX in pre-term infants has not been established. Safety data are
available in pre-term infants (ROTARIX = 134, placebo = 120) with a reported gestational age
36 weeks. These pre-term infants were followed for SAEs up to 30 to 90 days after Dose 2.
SAEs were observed in 5.2% of recipients of ROTARIX as compared with 5.0% of placebo
recipients. No deaths or cases of intussusception were reported in this population.

DESCRIPTION

ROTARIX (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral), for oral administration, is a live, attenuated rotavirus
vaccine derived from the human 89-12 strain which belongs to G1P[8] type. The rotavirus
vaccine strain is propagated on Vero cells.

14

There are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation (supplied in a
vial and oral dosing applicator presentation) and a liquid formulation (supplied in an oral dosing
applicator only presentation).
Formulation for the Vial and Oral Dosing Applicator Presentation
After reconstitution of the lyophilized vaccine component, each 1 mL dose of the ROTARIX
formulation for the vial and oral dosing applicator presentation contains at least 106.0 median Cell
Culture Infective Dose (CCID50) of live, attenuated rotavirus.
The lyophilized vaccine component of this ROTARIX formulation contains amino acids,
dextran, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), sorbitol, and sucrose. DMEM contains
the following ingredients: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, ferric (III)
nitrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium pyruvate, D-glucose, concentrated vitamin
solution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, amino acids solution, L-glutamine, calcium chloride, and sodium
hydrogenocarbonate.
In the manufacturing process, porcine-derived materials are used. Porcine circovirus type 1
(PCV-1) is present in this ROTARIX formulation. PCV-1 is not known to cause disease in
humans.
The liquid diluent contains calcium carbonate, sterile water, and xanthan. The diluent includes an
antacid component (calcium carbonate) to protect the vaccine during passage through the
stomach and prevent its inactivation due to the acidic environment of the stomach.
This ROTARIX formulation is available in single-dose vials of lyophilized vaccine,
accompanied by a prefilled oral dosing applicator of liquid diluent [see How Supplied/Storage
and Handling (16)]. The tip caps of the prefilled oral dosing applicators contain natural rubber
latex; the vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex.
This ROTARIX formulation contains no preservatives.
Formulation for the Oral Dosing Applicator Only Presentation
Each 1.5 mL dose of the ROTARIX formulation for the oral dosing applicator only presentation
contains at least 106.0 CCID50 of live, attenuated rotavirus.
This ROTARIX formulation contains disodium adipate, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM), sucrose, and sterile water. DMEM contains the following ingredients: sodium
chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, ferric (III) nitrate, sodium dihydrogen
phosphate, sodium pyruvate, D-glucose, concentrated vitamin solution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine,
amino acids solution, L-glutamine, calcium chloride, and sodium hydrogenocarbonate.
This ROTARIX formulation contains an antacid component (disodium adipate) to protect the
vaccine during passage through the stomach and prevent its inactivation due to the acidic
environment of the stomach.

15

This ROTARIX formulation is available in single-dose prefilled oral dosing applicator [see How

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1

Mechanism of Action

The exact immunologic mechanism by which ROTARIX protects against rotavirus
gastroenteritis is unknown [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. ROTARIX contains a live, attenuated
human rotavirus that replicates in the small intestine and induces immunity.
12.2

Pharmacodynamics

Shedding and Transmission
A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in the
Dominican Republic in twins within the same household to assess whether transmission of
vaccine virus occurs from a vaccinated infant to a non-vaccinated infant (Study 20;
NCT00396630). One hundred pairs of healthy twins 6 to 14 weeks of age (gestational age
32 weeks) were randomized with one twin to receive ROTARIX (n = 100) and the other twin to
receive placebo (n = 100). Twenty subjects in each arm were excluded for reasons such as
having rotavirus antibody at baseline. Stool samples were collected on the day of or 1 day prior
to each dose, as well as 3 times weekly for 6 consecutive weeks after each dose of ROTARIX or
placebo. Transmission was defined as presence of the vaccine virus strain in any stool sample
from a twin receiving placebo.
Transmitted vaccine virus was identified in 15 of 80 twins receiving placebo (18.8% [95% CI:
10.9, 29.0]). Median duration of the rotavirus shedding was 10 days in twins who received
ROTARIX as compared with 4 days in twins who received placebo in whom the vaccine virus
was transmitted. In the 15 twins who received placebo, no gastrointestinal symptoms related to
transmitted vaccine virus were observed.
13

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

ROTARIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of
fertility.
14

CLINICAL STUDIES

There are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation (supplied in a
vial and oral dosing applicator presentation) and a liquid formulation (supplied in an oral dosing
applicator only presentation) [see Description (11)]. Efficacy was evaluated using the
16

reconstituted lyophilized formulation [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3)]. These data are
relevant to the liquid formulation because both formulations contain the same live, attenuated
rotavirus strain and are manufactured using a similar process.
14.1

Efficacy Studies

The data demonstrating the efficacy of ROTARIX in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis come
from 24,163 infants randomized in two placebo-controlled studies conducted in 17 countries in
Europe and Latin America (Studies 5 and 8). In these studies, oral polio vaccine (OPV) was not
coadministered; however, other routine childhood vaccines could be concomitantly administered.
Breastfeeding was permitted in both studies.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 6 European countries
(Study 5). A total of 3,994 infants were enrolled to receive ROTARIX (n = 2,646) or placebo
(n = 1,348). Vaccine or placebo was given to healthy infants as a 2-dose series with the first dose
administered orally from 6 through 14 weeks of age followed by one additional dose
administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose. The 2-dose series was completed by 24 weeks
of age. For both vaccination groups, 98.3% of infants were White and 53% were male.
The clinical case definition of rotavirus gastroenteritis was an episode of diarrhea (passage of 3
or more loose or watery stools within a day), with or without vomiting, where rotavirus was
identified in a stool sample. Severity of gastroenteritis was determined by a clinical scoring
system, the Vesikari scale, assessing the duration and intensity of diarrhea and vomiting, the
intensity of fever, use of rehydration therapy, or hospitalization for each episode. Scores range
from 0 to 20, where higher scores indicate greater severity. An episode of gastroenteritis with a
score of 11 or greater was considered severe.6
The primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of any grade of severity of rotavirus
gastroenteritis caused by naturally occurring rotavirus from 2 weeks after the second dose
through one rotavirus season (according to protocol, ATP). Other efficacy evaluations included
prevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, as defined by the Vesikari scale, and reductions in
hospitalizations due to rotavirus gastroenteritis and all-cause gastroenteritis regardless of
presumed etiology. Analyses were also done to evaluate the efficacy of ROTARIX against
rotavirus gastroenteritis among infants who received at least one vaccination (total vaccinated
cohort, TVC).
Efficacy of ROTARIX against any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis through one
rotavirus season was 87.1% (95% CI: 79.6, 92.1); TVC efficacy was 87.3% (95% CI: 80.3,
92.0). Efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through one rotavirus season was 95.8%
(95% CI: 89.6, 98.7); TVC efficacy was 96.0% (95% CI: 90.2, 98.8) (Table 5). The protective
effect of ROTARIX against any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis observed
immediately following Dose 1 administration and prior to Dose 2 was 89.8% (95% CI: 8.9,
99.8).
17

Efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through one
rotavirus season was 100% (95% CI: 81.8, 100); TVC efficacy was 100% (95% CI: 81.7, 100)
(Table 5). ROTARIX reduced hospitalizations for all-cause gastroenteritis regardless of
presumed etiology by 74.7% (95% CI: 45.5, 88.9).

placebo (n = 31,552). An efficacy subset of these infants consisting of 20,169 infants from Latin
America received ROTARIX (n = 10,159) or placebo (n = 10,010). Vaccine or placebo was
given to healthy infants as a 2-dose series with the first dose administered orally from 6 through
13 weeks of age followed by one additional dose administered at least 4 weeks after the first
dose. The 2-dose series was completed by 24 weeks of age. For both vaccination groups, the
racial distribution of the efficacy subset was as follows: Hispanic 85.8%, White 7.9%, Black
1.1%, and other 5.2%; 51% were male.

18

The clinical case definition of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was an episode of diarrhea
(passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools within a day), with or without vomiting, where
rotavirus was identified in a stool sample, requiring hospitalization and/or rehydration therapy
equivalent to World Health Organization (WHO) plan B (oral rehydration therapy) or plan C
(intravenous rehydration therapy) in a medical facility.
The primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by
naturally occurring rotavirus from 2 weeks after the second dose through one year (ATP).
Analyses were done to evaluate the efficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis
among infants who received at least one vaccination (TVC). Reduction in hospitalizations due to
rotavirus gastroenteritis was also evaluated (ATP).
Efficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through one year was 84.7% (95%
CI: 71.7, 92.4); TVC efficacy was 81.1% (95% CI: 68.5, 89.3) (Table 6).
Efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through one year
was 85.0% (95% CI: 69.6, 93.5); TVC efficacy was 80.8% (95% CI: 65.7, 90.0) (Table 6).

Efficacy through Two Rotavirus Seasons

The efficacy of ROTARIX persisting through two rotavirus seasons was evaluated in two
studies.
In the European study (Study 5), the efficacy of ROTARIX against any grade of severity of
rotavirus gastroenteritis through two rotavirus seasons was 78.9% (95% CI: 72.7, 83.8). Efficacy
in preventing any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the
second season post-vaccination was 71.9% (95% CI: 61.2, 79.8). The efficacy of ROTARIX
against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through two rotavirus seasons was 90.4% (95% CI: 85.1,
94.1). Efficacy in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the
second season post-vaccination was 85.6% (95% CI: 75.8, 91.9).
The efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through two
rotavirus seasons was 96.0% (95% CI: 83.8, 99.5).
In the Latin American study (Study 8), the efficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus
gastroenteritis through two years was 80.5% (95% CI: 71.3, 87.1). Efficacy in preventing severe
rotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the second year post-vaccination was 79.0%
(95% CI: 66.4, 87.4). The efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus
gastroenteritis through two years was 83.0% (95% CI: 73.1, 89.7).
The efficacy of ROTARIX beyond the second season post-vaccination was not evaluated.
14.3

Efficacy against Specific Rotavirus Types

The type-specific efficacy against any grade of severity and severe rotavirus gastroenteritis
caused by G1P[8], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and combined non-G1 (G2, G3, G4, G9) types was
statistically significant through one year. Additionally, type-specific efficacy against any grade
of severity and severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8],
G9P[8], and combined non-G1 (G2, G3, G4, G9) types was statistically significant through two
years (Table 7).

Immunogenicity

A relationship between antibody responses to rotavirus vaccination and protection against
rotavirus gastroenteritis has not been established. Seroconversion was defined as the appearance
of anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies (concentration 20 U/mL) post-vaccination in the serum of
infants previously negative for rotavirus.
In 2 safety and efficacy studies (Studies 5 and 8), one to two months after a 2-dose series, 86.5%
of 787 recipients of ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation seroconverted compared
with 6.7% of 420 placebo recipients, and 76.8% of 393 recipients of ROTARIX reconstituted
lyophilized formulation seroconverted compared with 9.7% of 341 placebo recipients,
respectively.
Immunogenicity of a 2-dose series of ROTARIX liquid formulation was evaluated in Study 9.
This study compared seroconversion rates and Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs)
following administration of the ROTARIX liquid formulation (n = 984) or the ROTARIX
reconstituted lyophilized formulation (n = 329). The primary analyses demonstrated noninferiority of IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs at 1 to 2 months post-vaccination for the
ROTARIX liquid formulation group compared to the ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized
formulation group (Lower Limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates ≥-10%;
Lower Limit of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio ≥0.67).
In Study 10, 3 months after a 2-dose series, the percentage of subjects with anti-rotavirus IgA
antibodies (concentration ≥20 U/mL) was comparable after administration of the ROTARIX
liquid formulation (76.3% of 417) and the ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation
(78.9% of 426).
14.5

Concomitant Vaccine Administration

In clinical trials, ROTARIX was administered concomitantly with U.S.-licensed and non–U.S.licensed vaccines. In a U.S. concomitant vaccine administration study (Study 18) using
ROTARIX (reconstituted lyophilized formulation) in 484 infants, there was no evidence of
interference in the immune responses to any of the antigens when PEDIARIX [Diphtheria and
Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant) and Inactivated
Poliovirus Vaccine], a U.S.-licensed 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals Inc.), and a U.S.-licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur SA)
were concomitantly administered with ROTARIX as compared with separate administration of
ROTARIX.
In a concomitant vaccine administration study (Study 10) in 1,272 infants, non-inferiority was
demonstrated regarding the immune response to each of the antigens in PEDIARIX, HIBERIX
[Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate)], and a U.S.-licensed, 13-valent
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Pfizer Inc.) when concomitantly administered with the

22

ROTARIX liquid formulation as compared to when concomitantly administered with the
ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation.

ROTARIX (ROW-tah-rix)
Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral
What is ROTARIX?
ROTARIX is a vaccine that protects your baby from a kind of virus (called a rotavirus) that can cause bad
diarrhea and vomiting. Rotavirus can cause diarrhea and vomiting that is so bad that your baby can lose
too much body fluid and need to go to the hospital.
Rotavirus vaccine is a liquid that is given to your baby by mouth. It is not an injection.
Who should not take ROTARIX?
Your baby should not get ROTARIX if:
•

he or she has had an allergic reaction after getting a dose of ROTARIX.

•

he or she is allergic to any of the ingredients of this vaccine. A list of ingredients can be found at the
end of this leaflet.

•

a doctor has told you that your baby’s digestive system has a defect (is not normal).

•

he or she has a history of a serious problem called intussusception that happens when a part of the
intestine gets blocked or twisted.

•

he or she has Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID), a severe problem with his/her
immune system.

Tell your doctor if your baby:
•

is allergic to latex.

•

has problems with his/her immune system.

•

has cancer.

•

will be in close contact with someone who has problems with his/her immune system or is getting
treated for cancer, as the spread of vaccine virus to non-vaccinated contacts could occur. Hand
washing is recommended after diaper changes to help prevent the spread of vaccine virus.

If your baby has been having diarrhea and vomiting, your doctor may want to wait before giving your
baby a dose of ROTARIX.

How is ROTARIX given?
ROTARIX is a liquid that is dropped into your baby’s mouth and swallowed.

Your baby will get the first dose at around 6 weeks old.
The second dose will be at least 4 weeks after the first dose (before 6 months old).
Be sure to plan the time for your baby’s second dose with the doctor because it is important that your
baby gets both doses of ROTARIX before your baby is 6 months old.
The doctor may decide to give your baby other vaccines at the same time as ROTARIX.
Your baby can be fed normally after getting ROTARIX.
What are possible side effects of ROTARIX?
The most common side effects of ROTARIX are:
•

crying

•

fussiness

•

cough

•

runny nose

•

fever

•

loss of appetite

•

vomiting.

Call your doctor right away or go to the emergency department if your baby has any of these problems
after getting ROTARIX, even if it has been several weeks since the last vaccine dose because these may
be signs of a serious problem called intussusception:
•

bad vomiting

•

bad diarrhea

•

bloody bowel movement

•

high fever

•

severe stomach pain (if your baby brings his/her knees to his/her chest while crying or screaming).

Studies showed an increased risk of intussusception after the first and second dose of vaccine,
especially in the first 7 days.
Since FDA approval, reports of infants with intussusception have been received by Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (VAERS). Intussusception occurred days and sometimes weeks after
vaccination. Some infants needed hospitalization, surgery on their intestines, or a special enema to treat
this problem. Death due to intussusception has occurred.

Other reported side effects include: Kawasaki disease (a serious condition that can affect the heart;
symptoms may include fever, rash, red eyes, red mouth, swollen glands, swollen hands and feet, and, if
not treated, death can occur).
Talk to your baby’s doctor if your baby has any problems that concern you.
