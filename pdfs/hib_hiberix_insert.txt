DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS

HIBERIX is a solution for injection.
For the vial and vial presentation a single dose after reconstitution is 0.5 mL.
For the vial and prefilled syringe presentation a single dose after reconstitution is approximately
0.5 mL.
4

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any H. influenzae type b- or
tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine or any component of the vaccine is a contraindication to
administration of HIBERIX [see Description (11)].
5

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1

Guillain-Barré Syndrome

If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing
tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including HIBERIX,
should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks.
5.2

Syncope

Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including
HIBERIX. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual
disturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to
avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope.
5.3

Apnea in Premature Infants

Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely.
Decisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including HIBERIX, to infants
born prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status, and
the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination.
5.4

Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions

Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the patient's immunization history
for possible vaccine hypersensitivity. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the
4

control of immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute
anaphylactic reaction occur.
5.5

Altered Immunocompetence

Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX in immunosuppressed children have not been evaluated. If
HIBERIX is administered to immunosuppressed children, including children receiving
immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained.
5.6

Interference with Laboratory Tests

Urine antigen detection may not have a diagnostic value in suspected disease due to
H. influenzae type b within 1 to 2 weeks after receipt of a H. influenzae type b-containing
vaccine, including HIBERIX [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
5.7

Tetanus Immunization

Immunization with HIBERIX does not substitute for routine tetanus immunization.
6

ADVERSE REACTIONS

6.1

Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates
observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical
trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There is the
possibility that broad use of HIBERIX could reveal adverse reactions not observed in clinical
trials.
Across clinical trials, common solicited adverse reactions (≥20%) were pain and redness at the
injection site, irritability, drowsiness, fever, loss of appetite, fussiness, and restlessness.
Study 1: In a randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S., children were
vaccinated with HIBERIX (n = 2,963), a U.S.-licensed monovalent Haemophilus b Conjugate
Vaccine (Control PRP-T) (Sanofi Pasteur SA) (n = 520), or a U.S.-licensed combined Diphtheria
and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Inactivated Poliovirus and
Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (DTaP-IPV/Hib) (Sanofi Pasteur Ltd.) (n = 520) at 2, 4, and 6
months of age. HIBERIX and Control PRP-T (Sanofi Pasteur SA) were administered
concomitantly with PEDIARIX (DTaP-HBV-IPV) [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and
Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant) and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine]
and Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13) (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.) with
Doses 1, 2, and 3 and ROTARIX [Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral] with Doses 1 and 2. DTaPIPV/Hib was administered concomitantly with PCV13 and ENGERIX-B [Hepatitis B Vaccine
(Recombinant)] with Doses 1, 2, and 3 and ROTARIX with Doses 1 and 2. If a birth dose of
hepatitis B vaccine was received, ENGERIX-B was given with Doses 1 and 3. In the total
population, 51.2% were male; 61% were white, 8% were Asian, 9% were black, and 22% were
other racial/ethnic groups.
5

In Study 1, children received a booster dose of either HIBERIX (n = 2,336), a Haemophilus b
Conjugate Vaccine (Control PRP-T) (Sanofi Pasteur SA) (n = 435), or a combined Diphtheria
and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Inactivated Poliovirus and
Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (DTaP-IPV/Hib) (Sanofi Pasteur Ltd.) (n = 400) at 15 to 18
months of age (mean age: 15.6 months) following primary vaccination at 2, 4, and 6 months of
age with the same vaccine. The booster dose of HIBERIX and Control PRP-T (Sanofi Pasteur
SA) was administered concomitantly with INFANRIX (DTaP) [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids
and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed].
In 7 additional clinical studies, 1,008 children received HIBERIX as a booster dose following
primary vaccination with either HIBERIX (n = 530), Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Control
PRP-T) (Sanofi Pasteur SA) (n = 235), Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Merck & Co., Inc.)
(n = 26), or Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.) (no longer licensed
in the U.S., n = 217). None of the studies included a comparator group that received a booster
dose with a U.S.-licensed Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine. Studies were conducted in Europe,
Canada, and Latin America. Across these studies, the mean age of subjects at the time of booster
vaccination with HIBERIX ranged from 16 to 19 months. At the time of vaccination, 172
(17.1%) subjects were aged 11 to 14 months, 642 (63.7%) subjects were aged 15 to 18 months,
and 194 (19.2%) subjects were aged 19 to 25 months. Approximately half of the subjects were
male. Among subjects for whom information on race/ethnicity was available, nearly all subjects
were white.
In these 7 studies, HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with non-U.S. formulations
(containing 2.5 mg 2-phenoxyethanol per dose as preservative) of one of the following U.S.licensed vaccines: INFANRIX (DTaP) [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis
Vaccine Adsorbed], KINRIX (DTaP-IPV) [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular
Pertussis Adsorbed and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine], or PEDIARIX (DTaP-HBV-IPV). In the
studies, DTaP-IPV and DTaP-HBV-IPV were administered in dosing regimens not approved in
the U.S. Some subjects received DTaP-HBV (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, not licensed in
U.S.) concomitantly with HIBERIX.

Serious Adverse Reactions
In Study 1, one of 2,963 subjects who received HIBERIX and coadministered vaccines given at
2, 4, and 6 months of age experienced a serious adverse reaction which was in temporal
association with vaccination and had no alternative plausible causes (convulsion on Day 14 after
Dose 1). One of 2,336 subjects who received a booster dose of HIBERIX concomitantly with
INFANRIX experienced a serious adverse reaction which was in temporal association with

9

vaccination and had no alternative plausible causes (new onset febrile seizure on Day 1 after
Dose 4).
In the 7 additional studies, 2 of 1,008 subjects reported a serious adverse reaction that occurred
in the 31-day period following booster immunization with HIBERIX. One subject developed
bilateral pneumonia 9 days post-vaccination and one subject experienced asthenia following
accidental drug ingestion 18 days post-vaccination.
6.2

Postmarketing Experience

In addition to reports in clinical trials for HIBERIX, the following adverse reactions have been
identified during postapproval use of HIBERIX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily
from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or
establish a causal relationship to vaccination.
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions
Extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb, injection site induration.
Immune System Disorders
Allergic reactions (including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions), angioedema.
Nervous System Disorders
Convulsions (with or without fever), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (i.e., sudden onset of
hypotonia, hyporesponsiveness, and pallor or cyanosis), somnolence, syncope, or vasovagal
responses to injection.
Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders
Apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders
Rash, urticaria.
7

DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1

Interference with Laboratory Tests

Haemophilus b capsular polysaccharide derived from Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines has
been detected in the urine of some vaccinees.1 Urine antigen detection may not have a diagnostic
value in suspected disease due to H. influenzae type b within 1 to 2 weeks after receipt of a
H. influenzae type b-containing vaccine, including HIBERIX [see Warnings and Precautions
(5.6)].
7.2

Concomitant Vaccine Administration

In clinical studies, HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with routinely recommended
pediatric vaccines [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
10

7.3

Immunosuppressive Therapies

Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic
drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune
response to HIBERIX.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.4

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX in children younger than 6 weeks and in children aged 5 to
16 years have not been established.

DESCRIPTION

HIBERIX [Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate)] is a solution for
intramuscular injection, supplied as a sterile, lyophilized powder which is reconstituted at the
time of use with the accompanying saline diluent. HIBERIX contains Haemophilus b capsular
polysaccharide (polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate [PRP]), a high molecular weight polymer prepared
from the H. influenzae type b strain 20,752 grown in a synthetic medium that undergoes heat
inactivation and purification. The tetanus toxin, prepared from Clostridium tetani grown in a
semi-synthetic medium, is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified. The capsular
polysaccharide is covalently bound to the tetanus toxoid. After purification, the conjugate is
lyophilized in the presence of lactose as a stabilizer. The diluent for HIBERIX is a sterile saline
solution (0.9% sodium chloride) supplied in vials or prefilled syringes.
After reconstitution, each approximately 0.5-mL dose of HIBERIX contains 10 mcg of purified
capsular polysaccharide conjugated to approximately 25 mcg of tetanus toxoid, 12.6 mg of
lactose, and ≤0.5 mcg of residual formaldehyde.
HIBERIX does not contain a preservative.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1

Mechanism of Action

H. influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus. Most strains of H. influenzae that cause invasive
disease are type b. H. influenzae type b can cause invasive disease such as sepsis and meningitis.
Specific levels of antibodies to polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (anti-PRP) have been shown to
correlate with protection against invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b. Based on data from
passive antibody studies2 and a clinical efficacy study with unconjugated Haemophilus b
polysaccharide vaccine3, an anti-PRP concentration of 0.15 mcg/mL has been accepted as a
11

minimal protective level. Data from an efficacy study with unconjugated Haemophilus b
polysaccharide vaccine indicate that an anti-PRP concentration of ≥1.0 mcg/mL predicts
protection through at least a 1-year period.4,5 These antibody levels have been used to evaluate
the effectiveness of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines, including HIBERIX.

HIBERIX was non-inferior to Control PRP-T for percent of subjects achieving anti-PRP
≥0.15 mcg/mL (lower limit of 95% CI on difference of HIBERIX minus Control PRP-T ≥
predefined limit of -5%).
e
The non-inferiority criterion was not met (lower limit of 95% CI for the difference in the
percentages of subjects with anti-PRP ≥1.0 mcg/mL between two groups [HIBERIX minus
Control PRP-T] was -12.28%, which was lower than the predefined limit of -10%).
f
Analyses of anti-PRP immune responses following DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccination were
exploratory.
Booster Vaccination (Dose 4)
The immunogenicity of HIBERIX administered as a booster dose at 15 to 18 months of age was
evaluated in a subset of children from Study 1 (n = 336) in comparison with U.S.-licensed
vaccines following primary vaccination at 2, 4, and 6 months of age [see Adverse Reactions
(6.1)]. The booster dose of HIBERIX and Control PRP-T (Sanofi Pasteur SA) was administered
concomitantly with INFANRIX.
Antibodies to PRP were measured in sera obtained immediately prior to and 1 month after
booster vaccination with HIBERIX or the control vaccines. Anti-PRP GMCs and seroprotection
rates are presented in Table 5.

In 6 additional clinical studies, the immune response to HIBERIX administered as a booster dose
was evaluated in a total of 415 children aged 12 to 23 months. At the time of vaccination, 30
children were aged 12 to 14 months, 316 children were aged 15 to 18 months, and 69 children
were aged 19 to 23 months. Among subjects, 43% to 60% were male. Among subjects for whom
information on race/ethnicity was available, nearly all subjects were white. None of the studies
included a comparator group that received a booster dose with a U.S.-licensed Haemophilus b
Conjugate Vaccine. Characteristics of 3 of these studies are presented in Table 6.

Concomitant Vaccine Administration

Primary Series Vaccination (Doses 1, 2, and 3)
In U.S. Study 1, subjects who received HIBERIX concomitantly with PEDIARIX (DTaP-HBVIPV) and PCV13 at 2, 4, and 6 months of age had no evidence for reduced antibody responses
relative to the response in control subjects administered Control PRP-T (Sanofi Pasteur SA)
concomitantly with PEDIARIX (DTaP-HBV-IPV) and PCV13, to pertussis antigens (GMC to
pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and pertactin), diphtheria toxoid (antibody levels
≥0.1 IU/mL), tetanus toxoid (antibody levels ≥0.1 IU/mL), poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 (antibody
levels ≥1:8 to each virus), PCV13 (antibody levels ≥0.2 mcg/mL and GMC to each serotype), or
hepatitis B (anti-hepatitis B surface antigen ≥10 mIU/mL). The immune responses to PEDIARIX
(DTaP-HBV-IPV) and PCV13 were evaluated 1 month following Dose 3. Subjects in both
groups received ROTARIX at 2 and 4 months of age.
Booster Vaccination (Dose 4)
In U.S. Study 1, subjects who received a booster dose of HIBERIX concomitantly with
INFANRIX at 15 to 18 months of age had no evidence for reduced antibody responses to

16

pertussis antigens (GMC to pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and pertactin), diphtheria
toxoid (antibody levels ≥0.1 IU/mL), and tetanus toxoid (antibody levels ≥0.1 IU/mL), relative to
the responses in control subjects administered Control PRP-T (Sanofi Pasteur SA) concomitantly
with INFANRIX.
In 7 additional studies, a booster dose of HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with nonU.S. formulations of INFANRIX, KINRIX, and PEDIARIX. Non-U.S. formulations of KINRIX
and PEDIARIX were administered in dosing regimens not approved in the U.S.
Sufficient data are not available to confirm lack of interference in immune responses to vaccines
other than INFANRIX administered concomitantly with a booster dose of HIBERIX.
