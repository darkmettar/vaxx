injection site (>50%), drowsiness (>40% in individuals less than 2 years of age), fatigue and muscle pain (>20%
in individuals 2 years of age and older), decreased appetite (>20% in individuals less than 2 years of age),
injection site swelling and injection site redness (>10%), headache (>10% in individuals 5 years of age and
older), and fever (>10% in individuals less than 2 years of age).
In individuals 18 through 59 years of age, the most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions >10% were
pain at the injection site (>70%), muscle pain (>50%), fatigue (>40%), headache (>30%), and arthralgia and
injection site swelling (>10%).
In individuals 60 years of age and older, the most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions >10% were
pain at the injection site (>50%), muscle pain and fatigue (>30%), headache (>20%), and arthralgia (>10%).
Clinical Trial Experience in Individuals 6 Weeks Through 17 Years of Age
The safety of Prevnar 20 in individuals from 6 weeks through 17 years of age was evaluated in 3 randomized,
double-blind, active-controlled, clinical trials and one single-arm clinical trial. Across the 4 pediatric trials
(Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11; NCT04382326, NCT04379713, NCT03512288, and NCT04642079, respectively)
conducted in the Americas and Europe, 3063 participants received at least one dose of Prevnar 20, and 1720
participants received at least one dose of Prevnar 13.
Safety Assessment in Individuals Receiving a 4-Dose Series (Studies 8 through 10)
The safety of Prevnar 20 was assessed in 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical trials in
participants (Studies 8, 9, and 10). Globally, 2232 participants who received at least one dose of a 4-dose series
of Prevnar 20 and 1717 participants who received at least one dose of a 4-dose series of Prevnar 13 were
included in the safety analysis. In the United States (US) (including the US territory of Puerto Rico [PR]), 1567
participants received at least one dose of a 4-dose series of Prevnar 20 and 1376 participants received at least
one dose of a 4-dose series of Prevnar 13. Study 8 was a double-blind, active-controlled trial of safety and
immunogenicity in participants randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose series of either Prevnar 20 (N=1001) or
Prevnar 13 (N=990) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age, conducted in the US and PR. Study 9 was a
double-blind trial of tolerability and safety in participants randomized 2:1 to receive a 4-dose series of either
Prevnar 20 (N=1000) or Prevnar 13 (N=503) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age, conducted in countries
in Europe, South America, and North America, including the US and PR. Study 10 was a double-blind, activecontrolled multicenter trial of safety and immunogenicity in participants randomized 1:1 to receive a 4-dose
series of either Prevnar 20 (N=231) or Prevnar 13 (N=227) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age, conducted in the
US.
Across the 3 infant trials, there were similar percentages of male (51.7% and 50.1%) and female (48.3% and
49.9%) participants among the Prevnar 20 and Prevnar 13 recipients respectively. Participant age at the first
dose (median age: 64.0 days, range: 42 to 98 days; median age: 64.0 days, range 43 to 97 days) and last dose
(median age: 372.0 days, range 365 to 460 days; median age: 372.0 days, range 366 to 455 days) in the Prevnar
20 and Prevnar 13 groups, respectively, was similar. The racial and ethnic distribution of the US/PR infant
safety population was as follows: 73.8% of Prevnar 20 recipients were White, 12.1% Black, 1.9% Asian, and
5

7.5% multi-racial; 29.7% were Hispanic) with similar distribution among Prevnar 13 recipients. In the multicountry infant trial, Study 9, the participants were predominantly White (87.4%). This study also included 111
late preterm infants (>34 to <37 weeks gestational age) among the total study population 77 were in the Prevnar
20 group, and 34 in the Prevnar 13 group.
In Study 8, Pediarix [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B
(Recombinant) and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine Combined] (DTaP-HBV-IPV) and Hiberix [(Haemophilus
influenzae type b Conjugate vaccine) [Hib] (Tetanus Toxoid conjugate)] were administered concomitantly with
Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, and 6 months of age; M-M-R II [Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine
Live] (MMR) and VARIVAX [Varicella virus vaccine live] were administered concomitantly with Prevnar 20
or Prevnar 13 at 12 through 15 months of age. In Study 10, Pediarix was administered concomitantly with
Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. In Studies 8 and 10, influenza and rotavirus vaccines
were also permitted to be co-administered with Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13 according to recommendations. The
proportion of participants receiving a concomitant influenza vaccine and the proportions of participants
receiving a concomitant rotavirus vaccine were similar across the two study groups in Studies 8 and 10. In
Study 8, 65.8% to 87.3% of participants received a rotavirus vaccine with each of the first 3 doses of Prevnar
20; 11.7% and 10.1% of participants received an influenza vaccine with Dose 3 and Dose 4 of Prevnar 20,
respectively. In Study 10, 65.3% to 94.8% of participants received a rotavirus vaccine with each of the first 3
doses of Prevnar 20; 21.4% of participants received an influenza vaccine with Dose 3 of Prevnar 20. In Study 9,
US-licensed or non-US licensed routine pediatric vaccines were permitted to be given during the study,
including with Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13, according to local or national recommendations.
Across the infant trials, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were recorded daily by parents/guardians
using an electronic diary for 7 consecutive days following each vaccination. Adverse events (AEs) were
reported from administration of the first dose until one month after the third dose, and from the fourth dose
through one month after the fourth dose. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and newly diagnosed chronic medical
conditions (NDCMCs) were reported from administration of the first dose through 6 months after the last dose.
Solicited Adverse Events in Individuals Receiving a 4-Dose Series (Study 8)
The percentage of participants in Study 8 with solicited local and systemic adverse reactions that occurred
within 7 days following vaccination are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The median day of onset for local and
systemic reactions was between Day 1 and Day 2 (Day 1 was the day of vaccination), and reactions resolved
with a median duration between 1 to 2 (local reactions) or 3 days (systemic reactions).

Note: Systemic reactions and use of antipyretic/pain medication were collected in the e-diary from Day 1 through Day 7 after each dose. If a severe
reaction was identified by the investigator as a Grade 4 reaction at a follow-up assessment, it was also reported as an adverse reaction.
a. Study 8 was conducted in the United States and the territory of Puerto Rico (NCT04382326).
b. N = number of participants with any e-diary data reported after the specified dose. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculations.
c. Mild: easily consolable; moderate: requiring increased attention; severe: inconsolable; crying cannot be comforted.
d. Any includes all participants who reported a reaction as mild, moderate, or severe during Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination
e. Mild: increased or prolonged sleeping bouts; moderate: slightly subdued interfering with daily activity; severe: disabling not interested in usual daily
activity.
f. Mild: decreased interest in eating; moderate: decreased oral intake; severe: refusal to feed.
g. Any systemic reaction: includes all participants who reported any fever ≥38.0°C or any other systemic reaction (irritability, drowsiness or decreased
appetite) as mild, moderate, or severe during Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination. The route of temperature measurement was to be rectal.
h. Severity was not collected for use of antipyretic or pain medication. The numbers listed reflect yes responses (i.e., number of events reported).

Unsolicited Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events in Individuals Receiving a 4-Dose Series (Studies 8
through 10)
Globally, across the 3 infant trials, the proportion of participants reporting 1 or more SAEs within 6 months
after the fourth dose of Prevnar 20 was 4.5% (101 of 2232 participants). This was similar to the proportion of
participants with SAEs after vaccination with Prevnar 13 3.7% (64 of 1717 participants). The proportions of
SAEs observed from the first dose to 1 month after the third dose were 1.1% and 1.2% for Prevnar 20 and
Prevnar 13, and from the fourth dose to 1 month after the fourth dose were 0.7% and 0.5% respectively.
Participants in these studies may have received other US-licensed (Studies 8, 9, and 10) or non-US-licensed
concomitant (Study 9) vaccines according to their local recommended schedule. In the Prevnar 20 group, two
febrile seizures considered possibly related to vaccination with Prevnar 20 were reported. One case was serious
and occurred 14 days after the fourth dose given with MMR and varicella vaccine. One case was non-serious
and occurred 7 days after the fourth dose of Prevnar 20 in an individual with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
One participant experienced isolated injection site hypersensitivity (redness) within approximately 30 minutes
of Prevnar 20 after each of the first 3 doses resolving on the same day, this was not observed after the fourth
dose.
There were no notable patterns or imbalances between vaccine groups for specific categories of SAEs that
would suggest a causal relationship to Prevnar 20.
Safety Assessment in Individuals 15 Months Through 17 Years of Age Receiving Catch-Up Vaccination (Study
11)
The safety of Prevnar 20 in individuals (15 months through 17 years of age) was assessed in a single-arm trial
of safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of Prevnar 20 conducted in the United States (Study 11) (NCT
04642079). A total of 831 participants received a single dose of Prevnar 20 among the 4 age groups (≥15 to <24
months, ≥2 to <5 years, ≥5 to <10 years, and ≥10 to <18 years). Participants <5 years of age were eligible if
they had received at least 3 prior doses of Prevnar 13. Routine pediatric vaccines including DTaP vaccines, Hib,
hepatitis A, and influenza vaccines were permitted to be co-administered with Prevnar 20, if not feasible to
separate from Prevnar 20 by 14 days. There were similar percentages of male and female participants, with the
8

exception of a higher percentage of male than female participants (approximately 56% males) in the age groups
≥15 months to <24 months of age and ≥10 to <18 years of age. Participants were predominantly White (80.1%
to 86.6%), with nearly all the other participants being Black or African American (8.3% to 12.4%) and
multiracial (2.5% to 6.0%); 15.4% to 21.0% were Hispanic.
The safety assessment was consistent with that used in studies 8 through 10, with the exception of that ageapplicable systemic adverse reactions were recorded. The types of solicited systemic events collected in the
participants ≥15 months to <2 years of age were consistent with those collected in participants 6 weeks through
15 months of age (i.e., irritability, decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep and fever), while the solicited
systemic events in participants ≥2 years of age required verbal communication by the participant (i.e., fatigue,
headache, muscle pain, joint pain and fever).
Solicited Adverse Reactions in Individuals 15 Months Through 17 Years of Age Receiving Catch-Up
Vaccination (Study 11)
After a single dose of Prevnar 20, most local and systemic adverse reaction in individuals 15 months through 17
years of age were mild or moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days. The most frequently reported
local reaction was pain at injection site (52.5%, 66.0%, 82.9%, 82.0% in individuals ≥15 months to <24 months,
≥2 to <5 years, ≥5 to <10 years, and ≥10 to <18 years respectively), followed by redness and swelling. Most
local reactions were mild or moderate in severity.
The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in individuals ≥15 months to <2 years of age were
irritability (61.8%), followed by drowsiness and increased sleep (41.7%), and decreased appetite (25.0%). Fever
≥38.0°C was reported by 11.8% of individuals; fever >38.4°C was reported infrequently.
The most frequently reported systemic events in participants ≥2 to <18 years of age varied by age group.
Fatigue was most frequently reported in individuals ≥2 to <5 years of age, and muscle pain was most frequently
reported in participants ≥5 to <10 years and ≥10 to <18 years of age. Fever was reported infrequently (in ≤3.3%
of individuals ≥2 to <5 years of age and only 1 participant, 0.5% ≥5 to <10 years of age).
Serious Adverse Events in Individuals 15 Months Through 17 Years of Age (Study 11)
In Study 11, five participants reported SAEs within 6 months after vaccination (2 participants [1.0%] ≥15 to
<24 months of age and 3 participants [1.5%] ≥10 to <18 years of age). One participant (0.5%) ≥15 to
<24 months of age reported an SAE within 1 month after vaccination. No SAEs were considered related to the
vaccination.
Unsolicited Adverse Reactions Following the Use of Prevnar and Prevnar 13
Events observed in clinical trials with Prevnar (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197
Protein]) or Prevnar 13 in individuals 6 weeks through 15 months of age are relevant to Prevnar 20 since the
vaccines are manufactured and formulated similarly and contain 7 and 13 of the same polysaccharide
conjugates, respectively.
Reactions occurring in greater than 1% of infants and toddlers following administration of Prevnar 13: diarrhea,
vomiting, and rash.
Reactions occurring in less than 1% of infants and toddlers following administration of Prevnar 13: crying,
hypersensitivity reaction (including face edema, dyspnea, and bronchospasm), seizures (including febrile
seizures), and urticaria or urticaria-like rash.

Among 6,839 participants who received at least 1 dose of Prevnar 13 in clinical trials conducted globally, there
was 1 hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode adverse reaction reported (0.015%). Among 4,204 participants who
received at least 1 dose of Prevnar in clinical trials conducted globally, there were 3 hypotonic-hyporesponsive
episode adverse reactions reported (0.071%). All 4 events occurred in a single clinical trial in Brazil in which
participants received whole cell pertussis vaccine at the same time as Prevnar 13 or Prevnar.
Clinical Trials Experience With Prevnar 20 in Individuals 18 Years of Age and Older
The safety of a single dose of Prevnar 20 in individuals 18 years of age and older was evaluated in 6
randomized, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trials and one open-label, multicenter clinical trial. All of the
trials were conducted in the United States and 2 of the trials also enrolled participants (N=172) in Sweden.
Across the 7 trials, 6343 individuals received Prevnar 20 and 2496 received active control vaccine.
Safety Assessments in Pneumococcal Vaccine Naïve Participants 18 Years of Age and Older (Studies 1 through
5)
The safety of Prevnar 20 in individuals 18 years of age and older with no history of pneumococcal vaccination
was evaluated in 5 studies (Studies 1-5). In the main cohort of Study 1 (NCT03760146) and in Study 2
(NCT03313037), participants ≥60 years of age and participants 60 through 64 years of age, respectively,
received a single dose of Prevnar 20 followed 1 month later with administration of saline placebo or received a
single dose of Prevnar 13 followed 1 month later with a dose of PNEUMOVAX® 23 (PPSV23). The 2 other
cohorts of Study 1, participants 50 through 59 years of age and participants 18 through 49 years of age, received
a single vaccination with Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13. In Study 3 (NCT03828617), participants 18 through
49 years of age received a single vaccination with Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13. In Studies 4 (NCT02955160) and 5
(NCT03642847), which were smaller studies conducted early in the clinical development of Prevnar 20,
participants 18 through 49 years of age received a single dose of Prevnar 20 or an active control (Tdap or
Prevnar 13).
Safety Assessments in Participants ≥65 Years of Age (Pneumococcal Vaccine Naïve or Previously Immunized
with a Pneumococcal Vaccine) (Studies 6 and 7)
The safety of Prevnar 20 in individuals 65 years of age and older with pneumococcal vaccination given as
routine care prior to enrollment was assessed in Study 6 (NCT03835975). Participants were enrolled into 1 of
3 cohorts based on their prior pneumococcal vaccination history (PPSV23 only ≥1 to ≤5 years prior to
enrollment, Prevnar 13 only ≥6 months prior to enrollment, or Prevnar 13 followed by PPSV23 [with PPSV23
given ≥1 year prior to enrollment]). Participants in 2 of the cohorts received a single vaccination with Prevnar
20 or control pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar 13), and the other cohort received a single vaccination with
Prevnar 20. only.
The safety of Prevnar 20 in individuals 65 years of age and older when coadministered with Influenza Vaccine,
Adjuvanted (Fluad Quadrivalent) was assessed in Study 7 (NCT 04526574). Randomization was stratified by
prior pneumococcal vaccine status (no previous pneumococcal vaccine, receipt of at least 1 dose of PPSV23
only, receipt of at least 1 dose of Prevnar 13 only, or receipt of at least 1 dose each of PPSV23 and Prevnar 13).
Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Prevnar 20 concomitantly administered with Fluad
Quadrivalent (Group 1) or Fluad Quadrivalent followed approximately one month later by Prevnar 20
(Group 2).
Demographics of Trial Participants 18 Years of Age and Older (Studies 1, 3, 6 and 7)
10

In the three main trials (Studies 1, 3, and 6), participants were predominantly female (52.0% to 65.9%) across
groups defined by age and prior pneumococcal vaccination status within the Prevnar 20 and control vaccine
groups. Across all 3 trials combined, 59.8% of participants were 60 years of age and older, 6.9% were
50 through 59 years of age, and 33.3% were 18 through 49 years of age. In Studies 1 and 3, participants were
80.7% White, 14.2% Black, 2.1% Asian, and 10.3% Hispanic. In Study 6, participants were predominantly
White (92.4%). Participants were primarily from the United States; however a portion of participants 65 years
of age and older were enrolled from Sweden in Study 1 (5.7% of participants 60 years of age and older in that
study) and also in Study 6 (35.5% of participants with prior PPSV23 only). In Study 7, 54.7% of participants
were female. The mean age of participants was 72 years (range 65-103 years). Participants were 90.6% White,
6.9% Black, 1.2% Asian, and 9.4% Hispanic.
In the three main trials, participants with pre-existing underlying diseases were enrolled if the medical condition
was stable (did not require a significant change in therapy in the 6 weeks before receipt of study vaccine or any
hospitalization for worsening disease within 12 weeks before receipt of study vaccine). In Study 1,
approximately one-third of all participants had risk factors that placed them at increased risk for serious
pneumococcal disease, including smoking (12.9%), stable medical conditions of chronic cardiovascular disease
(5.5%), chronic pulmonary disease including asthma (8.7%), chronic liver disease (0.4%), and diabetes mellitus
(13.9%).
Safety Monitoring
Solicited adverse reactions for Prevnar 20 in the three main trials and Study 7 were monitored in participants
recording daily into an electronic diary their local adverse reactions for 10 consecutive days and systemic
reactions for 7 consecutive days following vaccination. Across all trials, serious and nonserious adverse events
were collected for 1 month after each vaccination. Safety follow-up of SAEs continued through 6 months after
vaccination with Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13 (or other appropriate control vaccine), as applicable. Newly
diagnosed chronic medical conditions occurring within 6 months after vaccination were also collected via
telephone contact.
Serious Adverse Events in Participants 18 Years of Age and Older (Studies 1 through 6)
Across studies 1 through 6, performed in individuals of all ages, naïve to and with prior pneumococcal
vaccination, the proportion of participants reporting 1 or more SAEs within 6 months after vaccination with
Prevnar 20 was 1.5% (67 of 4552 participants). This was similar to the proportion of participants with SAEs
after vaccination with Prevnar 13 or other applicable control vaccine (1.8%, 44 of 2496). The proportions of
participants with SAEs occurring within 1 month after vaccination with Prevnar 20 or with Prevnar 13 or other
applicable control vaccine were both 0.4% (19 of 4552 participants and 11 of 2496 participants, respectively).
There were no notable patterns or imbalances between vaccine groups for specific categories of serious adverse
events that would suggest a causal relationship to Prevnar 20.
Solicited Adverse Reactions in Participants 18 Years of Age and Older (Studies 1 and 6)
The frequency and severity of the local adverse reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site)
prompted daily in the 10 days after Prevnar 20 vaccination in individuals naïve to pneumococcal vaccination
(Study 1) and in individuals with prior pneumococcal vaccination (Study 6) are shown in Table 4 and Table 5,
respectively. The frequency and severity of the systemic adverse reactions (fever, fatigue, headache, muscle
pain, and joint pain) prompted daily in the 7 days after Prevnar 20 vaccination in individuals naïve to
pneumococcal vaccination (Study 1) and in individuals with prior pneumococcal vaccination (Study 6) are
shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.

Safety with Concomitant Vaccine Administration in Participants ≥65 years of age (Study 7)
In Study 7, the rates of local reactions at the Prevnar 20 injection site within 10 days after vaccination were
similar between participants who received Prevnar 20 and Fluad Quadrivalent concomitantly (Group 1) or
separately (Group 2). The rates of systemic reactions within 7 days following administration of Prevnar 20 were
generally numerically higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2; however, overall, fever in both groups was
uncommon (<1.5%) and other systemic reactions (fatigue, headache, muscle, or joint pain) were primarily mild
to moderate (≤0.9% were severe). The proportions of participants with SAEs occurring within 1 month after
vaccination with Prevnar 20 were 1.1% for Group 1 and 1.7% in Group 2. No SAEs occurring within 1 month
after vaccination with Prevnar 20 were considered related to vaccination.

6.2

Postmarketing Experience With Prevnar 13

The postmarketing safety experience with Prevnar 13 in individuals 6 weeks of age and older is relevant to
Prevnar 20 since the vaccines are manufactured and formulated similarly and contain 13 of the same
polysaccharide conjugates. These adverse reactions are included based on one or more of the following factors:
severity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship to Prevnar 13 vaccine. Because
these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably
estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure. The following adverse reactions
have been spontaneously reported during postapproval use of Prevnar 13 and may also be seen in postmarketing
experience with Prevnar 20.
• Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Lymphadenopathy localized to the region of the injection site
• Cardiac disorders: Cyanosis (pediatric populations only)
• General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Vaccination-site dermatitis, vaccination-site
pruritus, vaccination-site urticaria
• Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction, including shock
• Nervous system disorders: Hypotonia (pediatric populations only
• Respiratory: Apnea (pediatric populations only)
• Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioneurotic edema, Erythema multiforme
• Vascular disorders: Pallor (pediatric populations only)

DRUG INTERACTIONS
Prior Vaccination With PNEUMOVAX 23

In adults, receipt of PPSV23 1 to 5 years prior to Prevnar 20 resulted in diminished OPA geometric mean titers
(GMTs) to Prevnar 20 compared to OPA GMTs in recipients who received Prevnar 13 at least 6 months prior to
Prevnar 20, and compared to OPA GMTs in recipients who received Prevnar 13 followed by PPSV23, with the
last dose of PPSV23 given at least 1 year prior to Prevnar 20 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
7.2

Immunosuppressive Therapies

Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy (including
irradiation, corticosteroids, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and cytotoxic agents) may not respond optimally
to Prevnar 20.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Pregnancy

Risk Summary
All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the
estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to
4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Prevnar 20 in pregnant
women. Available data on Prevnar 20 administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform
vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.

16

A developmental toxicity study was performed in female rabbits administered Prevnar 20 prior to mating and
during gestation. The dose was 0.5 mL at each occasion (a single human dose is 0.5 mL). This study revealed
no evidence of harm to the fetus due to Prevnar 20 (see Data).
Data
Animal Data
In a developmental toxicity study, female rabbits were administered Prevnar 20 by intramuscular injection twice
prior to mating (17 days and 4 days prior to mating) and twice during gestation (Gestation Days 10 and 24),
0.5 mL/rabbit/occasion (a single human dose). No adverse effects on pre-weaning development were observed.
There were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations.
8.2

Lactation

Risk Summary
It is not known whether Prevnar 20 is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of
Prevnar 20 on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of
breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Prevnar 20 and any potential
adverse effects on the breastfed child from Prevnar 20 or from the underlying maternal condition. For
preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine.
8.4

Pediatric Use

The safety of Prevnar 20 has been established in individuals 6 weeks through 17 years of age [see Adverse
Reactions (6.1)].
The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 for the prevention of invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3,
4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F has been established in
individuals 6 weeks through 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 for the prevention of otitis media caused by serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F,
and 23F has been established in individuals 6 weeks through 5 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 in infants and children initiating vaccination at 7 months through 17 years of
age and in children 15 months through 17 years of age previously vaccinated or incompletely vaccinated with a
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is supported by evidence from clinical studies in younger children who
received a 4-dose series of Prevnar 20 and by evidence from clinical studies of catch-up vaccination with
Prevnar 13 and Prevnar.
The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 for the prevention of pneumonia has not been established in individuals
younger than 18 years of age.
The safety and effectiveness of Prevnar 20 in individuals younger than 6 weeks of age have not been
established.

8.5

Geriatric Use

Of the total number of Prevnar 20 recipients 18 years of age and older evaluated for safety in the 3 main clinical
trials (N=4263), 26.7% (n=1138) were 65 years of age and older and 1.7% (n=72) were 80 years of age and
older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
Prevnar 20 recipients 70 through 79 years of age and ≥80 years of age had lower OPA GMTs for all
pneumococcal serotypes compared to Prevnar 20 recipients 18 through 49 years, 50 through 59, and 60 through
64 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

11 DESCRIPTION
Prevnar 20, Pneumococcal 20-valent Conjugate Vaccine is a sterile suspension of saccharides of the capsular
antigens of S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F,
23F, and 33F, individually linked to non-toxic diphtheria CRM197 protein. Each serotype is grown in soy
peptone broth. The individual polysaccharides are purified by a series of chemical and physical methods. The
polysaccharides are chemically activated and then directly conjugated to the carrier protein CRM197, to form the
glycoconjugate. CRM197 is a non-toxic variant of diphtheria toxin isolated from cultures of Corynebacterium
diphtheriae strain C7 (β197) grown in a casamino acids and yeast extract-based medium or in a chemicallydefined medium. CRM197 is purified by a series of chemical and physical methods. The individual
glycoconjugates are purified by a series of chemical and physical methods and analyzed for saccharide to
protein ratios, molecular size, free saccharide, and free protein.
The individual glycoconjugates are compounded to formulate Prevnar 20. Potency of the formulated vaccine is
determined by quantification of each of the saccharide antigens and by the saccharide to protein ratios in the
individual glycoconjugates. Each 0.5 mL dose of the vaccine is formulated to contain approximately 2.2 μg of
each of S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F,
33F saccharides, 4.4 μg of 6B saccharides, 51 μg CRM197 carrier protein, 100 μg polysorbate 80, 295 μg
succinate buffer, 4.4 mg sodium chloride, and 125 μg aluminum as aluminum phosphate adjuvant.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
Protection against pneumococcal disease is conferred mainly by antibodies (immunoglobulin G [IgG] directed
against capsular polysaccharides) and OPA killing of S. pneumoniae. Prevnar 20 induces IgG antibodies and
OPA against the 20 vaccine serotypes.
An opsonic antibody titer or serotype-specific IgG concentration that is predictive of protection against invasive
pneumococcal disease or pneumococcal pneumonia has not been established.
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Prevnar 20 has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of
male fertility. Vaccination of female rabbits with Prevnar 20 had no effect on female fertility [see Use in
Specific Populations (8.1)].

14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1

Prevnar and Prevnar 13 Efficacy Data

Efficacy and effectiveness of Prevnar and Prevnar 13 are relevant to Prevnar 20, since Prevnar, Prevnar 13 and
Prevnar 20 are manufactured similarly. In addition, Prevnar and Prevnar 20 contain 7 of the same polysaccharide
conjugates and Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20 contain 13 of the same polysaccharide conjugates.
Prevnar Efficacy Data in Children
Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD)
Prevnar was licensed in the United States for infants and children in 2000, following a randomized,
double-blind, clinical trial in a multiethnic population at Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP) from
October 1995 through August 20, 1998, in which 37,816 infants were randomized to receive either Prevnar or a
control vaccine (an investigational meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine [MnCC]) at 2, 4, 6, and 12
through 15 months of age. In this study, the efficacy of Prevnar against invasive disease due to S. pneumoniae
in cases accrued during this period was 100% in both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 75.4%, 100% and 81.7%, 100%, respectively). Data accumulated through an extended
follow-up period to April 20, 1999, resulted in similar efficacy estimates of 97.4% in the per-protocol analysis
and 93.9% in the intent-to-treat analysis (95% CI: 82.7%, 99.9% and 79.6%, 98.5%, respectively).
Acute Otitis Media (AOM)
The efficacy of Prevnar against otitis media was assessed in 2 clinical trials: a trial in Finnish infants at the
National Public Health Institute and the efficacy trial in US infants at NCKP.
The Finnish Otitis Media (FinOM) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial in which 1,662 infants were
equally randomized to receive either Prevnar or a control vaccine Recombivax HB (Hepatitis B vaccine
(Recombinant) [Hep B]) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. In this study, conducted between
December 1995 and March 1999, parents of study participants were asked to bring their children to the study
clinics if the child had respiratory infections or symptoms suggesting AOM. If AOM was diagnosed,
tympanocentesis was performed, and the middle-ear fluid was cultured. If S. pneumoniae was isolated,
serotyping was performed. The primary endpoint was efficacy against AOM episodes caused by vaccine
serotypes in the per-protocol population.
The vaccine efficacy against AOM episodes due to vaccine serotypes assessed in the Finnish trial was 57%
(95% CI: 44%, 67%) in the per-protocol population and 54% (95% CI: 41%, 64%) in the intent-to-treat
population. The vaccine efficacy against AOM episodes due to vaccine-related serotypes (6A, 9N, 18B, 19A,
23A), also assessed in the Finnish trial, was 51% (95% CI: 27, 67) in the per-protocol population and 44% (95%
CI: 20, 62) in the intent-to-treat population. There was a nonsignificant increase in AOM episodes caused by
serotypes unrelated to the vaccine in the per-protocol population, compared to children who received the control
vaccine, suggesting that children who received Prevnar appeared to be at increased risk of otitis media due to
pneumococcal serotypes not represented in the vaccine. However, vaccination with Prevnar reduced
pneumococcal otitis media episodes overall. In the NCKP trial, in which the endpoint was all otitis media
episodes regardless of etiology, vaccine efficacy was 7% (95% CI: 4%, 10%) and 6% (95% CI: 4%, 9%),
respectively, in the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses. Several other otitis media endpoints were also
assessed in the 2 trials.
In the NCKP trial, the efficacy of Prevnar against otitis media was assessed from the beginning of the trial in
October 1995 through April 1998. The otitis media analysis included 34,146 infants randomized to receive
19

either Prevnar (N=17,070), or the control vaccine (N=17,076), at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. In
this trial, no routine tympanocentesis was performed, and no standard definition of otitis media was used by
study physicians. The primary otitis media endpoint was efficacy against all otitis media episodes in the
per-protocol population. Recurrent AOM, defined as 3 episodes in 6 months or 4 episodes in 12 months, was
reduced by 9% in both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations (95% CI: 3%, 15% in per-protocol and
95% CI: 4%, 14% in intent-to-treat) in the NCKP trial; a similar trend was observed in the Finnish trial. The
NCKP trial also demonstrated a 20% reduction (95% CI: 2, 35) in the placement of tympanostomy tubes in the
per-protocol population and a 21% reduction (95% CI: 4, 34) in the intent-to-treat population. Data from the
NCKP trial accumulated through an extended follow-up period to April 20, 1999, in which a total of 37,866
children were included (18,925 in Prevnar group and 18,941 in MnCC control group), resulted in similar otitis
media efficacy estimates for all endpoints.
Prevnar 13 Adult Efficacy Data
The efficacy of Prevnar 13 against vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and
IPD was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Community-Acquired Pneumonia
Immunization Trial in Adults [CAPiTA]) conducted over ~4 years in the Netherlands. A total of
84,496 participants 65 years of age and older received a single dose of either Prevnar 13 or placebo in a
1:1 randomization; 42,240 participants were vaccinated with Prevnar 13 and 42,256 participants were vaccinated
with placebo. Chronic medical conditions (asthma, diabetes, heart, liver, and/or lung diseases) were reported in
42.3% of study participants at baseline.
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of Prevnar 13 in the prevention of a first episode of
confirmed VT-CAP (defined as presence of ≥2 specified clinical criteria, chest X-ray consistent with CAP as
determined by a central committee of radiologists, and positive VT-specific urinary antigen detection assay
[UAD] or isolation of VT S. pneumoniae from blood or other sterile site). The secondary objectives were to
demonstrate the efficacy of Prevnar 13 in the prevention of a first episode of 1) confirmed
nonbacteremic/noninvasive (NB/NI) VT-CAP (an episode of VT-CAP for which the blood culture result and
any other sterile site culture results were negative for S. pneumoniae) and 2) VT-IPD (the presence of
S. pneumoniae in a sterile site).
Surveillance for suspected pneumonia and IPD began immediately after vaccination and continued through
identification of a prespecified number of cases. Participants who had a CAP or IPD episode with symptom
onset less than 14 days after vaccination were excluded from all analyses.
The median duration of follow-up per participant was 3.93 years. Prevnar 13 demonstrated statistically
significant vaccine efficacy (VE) in preventing first episodes of VT pneumococcal CAP, NB/NI VT
pneumococcal CAP, and VT-IPD (see Table 8).

14.2 Prevnar 20 Clinical Trials in Individuals 6 Weeks Through 15 Months of Age
Immunogenicity of Prevnar 20 in Individuals 6 Weeks Through 15 Months of Age
Prevnar 20 effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 6 weeks through 15 months of
age was demonstrated based on comparisons of serotype-specific antibody responses at 1 month after Dose 3
and 1 month after Dose 4 of Prevnar 20 to the antibody responses after vaccination with Prevnar 13.
Antibody responses elicited by Prevnar 20 and Prevnar 13 in these age groups were measured using a serotypespecific multiplex direct-binding Luminex® immunoassay (dLIA), designed to determine the concentration of
serotype-specific polysaccharide-binding IgG antibodies, and OPA assays to measure serotype-specific
functional OPA titers for the 20 pneumococcal serotypes of Prevnar 20. A serotype-specific IgG antibody
concentration corresponding to ≥0.35 µg/mL using the World Health Organization (WHO) enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used as the threshold value for the clinical evaluation of pneumococcal
conjugate vaccines when measured one month after Dose 3 of the 4-dose immunization series. The dLIA, used
to measure the IgG antibody concentration, was bridged to the WHO ELISA to establish dLIA specific
threshold values for each vaccine serotype that correspond to the established ≥0.35 µg/mL WHO ELISA
threshold value.
In Study 8, a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind trial, participants were randomized in a
1:1 ratio to receive Prevnar 20 (N=1004) or Prevnar 13 (N=993) in a 4-dose schedule; vaccine was administered
at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. Pediarix and Hiberix were administered concomitantly with each of
the 3 infant doses. M-M-R II and VARIVAX were administered with the fourth dose [see Adverse Reactions
(6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3)].
Study 8 assessed serotype-specific IgG response rates, IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and OPA
GMTs measured at one month after Dose 3 and one month after Dose 4 for all 20 serotypes contained in
Prevnar 20. For each of the 13 matched serotypes, IgG response in the Prevnar 20 group were compared with
the corresponding response in the Prevnar 13 group. For the 7 additional serotypes (serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F,
15B, 22F, and 33F), IgG response in the Prevnar 20 group were compared with the lowest response among the
13 matched vaccine serotypes excluding serotype 3 in the Prevnar 13 group.
21

Pneumococcal IgG Antibody Responses Following 3 Doses of Prevnar 20
IgG antibody responses following Prevnar 20 were noninferior to those following Prevnar 13 for 8 of the 13
matched serotypes and 6 of the 7 additional serotypes, as assessed by the percentage of participants meeting the
predefined serotype-specific IgG concentration one month after Dose 3, using a 10% noninferiority criterion (the
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages [Prevnar 20 minus Prevnar 13] greater than
-10%). Five of the 13 matched serotypes (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 9V and 23F) did not meet the pre-specified
noninferiority criterion, as the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the difference in percentages (Prevnar 20
minus Prevnar 13) were -12.1%, -20.1%, -12.0%, -11.3%, and -11.4% respectively. One additional serotype
(serotype 12F) also did not meet the NI criterion when compared to serotype 23F (the Prevnar 13 serotype with
the lowest percentage excluding serotype 3) in the Prevnar 13 group, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for
the difference in percentage (Prevnar 20 minus lowest Prevnar 13) was -41.6% (Table 9).
Additional IgG GMC data at one month after Dose 3 and OPA data at one month after Dose 3, presented in
Tables 10 and 12 respectively, support the effectiveness of Prevnar 20 for each of the 6 serotypes that failed to
meet the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion.

For the 7 additional serotypes, the percentage of participants with the predefined IgG concentration to serotype 23F (Prevnar 13 serotype
with the lowest percentage, excluding serotype 3) in the Prevnar 13 group was used in the calculation of the percentage difference.
For the 7 additional serotypes, percentages of participants with predefined IgG concentrations to serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F
and 33F in the Prevnar 13 group were 1.6%, 1.2%, 1.5%, 0.1%, 2.6%, 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively.

At 1 month after Dose 3, IgG GMCs in the Prevnar 20 group were noninferior to the corresponding IgG GMCs
in the Prevnar 13 group for all 20 vaccine serotypes, including the 6 serotypes that missed the noninferiority
criterion based on the percentage of participants meeting pre-defined IgG concentrations at one month after Dose
3. For each of the 13 matched serotypes, IgG GMCs in the Prevnar 20 group were noninferior to the
corresponding IgG GMCs in the Prevnar 13 group. For each of the 7 additional serotypes, IgG GMCs in the
Prevnar 20 group were noninferior to the IgG GMC for serotype 19A (the lowest result among the 13 matched
vaccine serotypes excluding serotype 3) in the Prevnar 13 group (Table 10).

Opsonophagocytic Activity Responses After 3 and 4 doses of Prevnar 20
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs at 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4 were descriptively evaluated in
a subset of participants who had received Prevnar 20 and Prevnar 13 in Study 8 (Table 12). For serotypes 1, 3,
4, 9V, 23F and 12F, for which non-inferiority was not met 1 month after Dose 3 (for the percentage of
participants meeting the pre-defined serotype-specific IgG concentration), OPA GMTs at 1 month after Dose 3
were numerically similar across groups for the 5 matched serotypes and an OPA antibody response was
generated to additional serotype 12F.

Prevnar 20 Clinical Trials in Individuals 18 Years of Age and Older

Immunogenicity of Prevnar 20 in Pneumococcal Vaccine Naïve Individuals
Prevnar 20 effectiveness in adults against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 20 vaccine serotypes
and against pneumonia caused by the 13 serotypes in Prevnar 13 was demonstrated based on comparative
immunogenicity to US-licensed pneumococcal vaccines (Prevnar 13 and PPSV23). Study 1, conducted in the
United States and Sweden, was designed to evaluate immunologic noninferiority of Prevnar 20 to Prevnar 13
(for the 13 original S. pneumoniae serotypes) and PPSV23 (for the 7 new S. pneumoniae serotypes) in
pneumococcal vaccine naive individuals ≥60 years of age. Antibody responses elicited by Prevnar 20 and the
control pneumococcal vaccines were measured by serotype-specific serum OPA assays for the 20
pneumococcal serotypes at 1-month post-vaccination. OPA assays were used to measure functional antibodies
to S. pneumoniae.
Study 1 included healthy individuals and immunocompetent individuals with stable underlying conditions,
including chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disorders, diabetes mellitus, chronic
liver disease, and medical risk conditions and behaviors (e.g., smoking) that are known to increase the risk of
serious pneumococcal pneumonia and IPD. A stable medical condition was defined as a medical condition not
requiring significant change in therapy in the previous 6 weeks (i.e., change to new therapy category due to
worsening disease) or any hospitalization for worsening disease within 12 weeks before receipt of the study
vaccine.
Comparison of Immune Responses of Prevnar 20 to Prevnar 13 and PPSV23 in Pneumococcal Vaccine Naïve
Individuals ≥60 Years of Age
In a randomized, active-controlled, double-blind noninferiority clinical trial (Study 1) of Prevnar 20 in the
United States and Sweden, pneumococcal vaccine -naïve individuals 18 years of age and older were enrolled
into 1 of 3 cohorts based on their age at enrollment and randomized to receive either Prevnar 20 or control.
Participants 60 years of age and older were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to Prevnar 20 followed 1 month later
with saline placebo or to Prevnar 13 followed 1 month later with PPSV23.
Serotype-specific OPA GMTs were measured before the first vaccination and 1 month after each vaccination.
Noninferiority of immune responses, OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination, with Prevnar 20 to a control
vaccine for a serotype was declared if the lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio
(Prevnar 20/Prevnar 13; Prevnar 20/PPSV23) for that serotype was greater than 0.5.
In individuals 60 years of age and older, immune responses to all 13 matched serotypes elicited by Prevnar 20
were noninferior to the immune responses to the serotypes elicited by Prevnar 13 one month after vaccination.
Immune responses to 6 out of the 7 additional serotypes induced by Prevnar 20 were noninferior to the immune
responses to these same serotypes induced by PPSV23 one month after vaccination. The response to serotype 8
missed the prespecified statistical noninferiority criterion by a small margin (the lower bound of the 2-sided
95% CI for the GMT ratio being 0.49 versus >0.50) (Table 13).

In supportive analyses, 77.8% of participants in the Prevnar 20 group achieved a ≥4-fold rise in serotype 8 OPA
titers from before vaccination to 1 month post-vaccination.

Immunobridging in Pneumococcal Vaccine Naïve Individuals 18 Through 59 Years of Age
In Study 1 (described above), the effectiveness of Prevnar 20 in individuals 50 through 59 years of age and in
individuals 18 through 49 years of age was inferred following comparison of the immune response to each of
the 20 vaccine serotypes in each of these age groups to the corresponding serotype-specific immune responses
in individuals 60 through 64 years of age following Prevnar 20 (immunobridging). In Study 1, pneumococcal
vaccine-naïve participants 50 through 59 years of age and 18 through 49 years of age were randomly assigned
(3:1 ratio) to receive 1 vaccination with Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13. Serotype-specific OPA GMTs were
measured before vaccination and 1 month after vaccination. A comparative analysis of Prevnar 20 in the
younger age group versus Prevnar 20 in individuals 60 through 64 years of age for each vaccine serotype was
performed to support the indication in individuals 18 through 49 years of age and 50 through 59 years of age.
Immunobridging was to be declared successful if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio
(Prevnar 20 in participants 18 through 49 years of age/60 through 64 years of age and in participants 50 through
59 years of age/60 through 64 years of age) for the 20 serotypes was >0.5 (2-fold). Prevnar 20 elicited
serotype-specific immune responses to each of the 20 vaccine serotypes in both of the younger age groups that
were within 2-fold of the corresponding serotype-specific responses in individuals 60 through 64 years of age,
when measured 1 month after vaccination (Table 14).

Immunogenicity of Prevnar 20 in Individuals Previously Vaccinated With Pneumococcal Vaccine
A randomized, open-label clinical trial (Study 6) described immune responses to Prevnar 20 in individuals 65
years of age and older previously vaccinated with PPSV23 (≥1 to ≤5 years prior to enrollment), previously
vaccinated with Prevnar 13 (≥6 months prior to enrollment), or previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13 followed
by PPSV23 (with PPSV23 vaccination ≥1 year prior to enrollment). Participants in this clinical trial previously
vaccinated with Prevnar 13 (Prevnar 13 only or followed by PPSV23) were enrolled at sites in the United States
and participants previously vaccinated with PPSV23 only were also enrolled from Swedish sites (35.5% in that
category). Immune responses elicited by Prevnar 20 were measured by an OPA assay.
OPA GMTs in participants who received PPSV23 1 to 5 years prior to Prevnar 20 were diminished compared to
OPA GMTs in participants who received Prevnar 13 at least 6 months previously and compared to OPA GMTs
in participants who received Prevnar 13 followed by PPSV23, with the last PPSV23 dose given at least 1 year
prior to Prevnar 20.
14.4 Concomitant Vaccine Administration
Individuals 6 Weeks Through 15 Months of Age
In Study 8, the concomitant administration of Pediarix and Hiberix with each of the 3 infant doses of either
Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13 were evaluated 1 month after the third dose. Concomitant administration of single
doses of M-M-R II and VARIVAX with the fourth dose of either Prevnar 20 or Prevnar 13 were evaluated
1 month following vaccination. There was no evidence that Prevnar 20, as compared to Prevnar 13, interfered
with the antibody responses to these concomitantly administered vaccines.
Individuals 65 Years of Age and Older
Clinical Trial in Individuals to Assess Prevnar 20 Given With Influenza Vaccine, Adjuvanted (Fluad
Quadrivalent)
Study 7 was a double-blind, randomized study conducted in individuals 65 years of age and older who had no
history of prior pneumococcal vaccination or who had previously received PPSV23 and/or Prevnar 13 at least 6
months prior to enrollment. Study participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Prevnar 20
concomitantly administered with Fluad Quadrivalent followed approximately one month later by placebo
30

(Group 1, N=898) or Fluad Quadrivalent concomitantly administered with placebo followed approximately one
month later by Prevnar 20 (Group 2, N=898). Pneumococcal serotype-specific OPA GMTs were evaluated 1
month after Prevnar 20 and influenza vaccine strain hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HAI) GMTs were
evaluated 1 month after Fluad Quadrivalent. The noninferiority criteria for the comparisons of OPA GMTs
(lower limit of the 2- sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio [Group 1/Group 2] >0.5, 2-fold noninferiority criterion)
were met for all 20 pneumococcal serotypes in Prevnar 20. The noninferiority criteria for the comparisons of
HAI GMTs (lower limit of the 2- sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio [Group 1/Group 2] >0.67, 1.5-fold
noninferiority criterion) were also met for all 4 influenza vaccine strains.
