1. Introduction
This Clinical Efficacy Supplement was submitted on May 13, 2016, to the
Biologics License Application (BLA) for Trumenba to include the final Clinical
Study Reports for the accelerated approval required studies: two confirmatory
studies (B1971009 and B1971016), and two postmarketing commitments: a
safety study (B1971014) and a concomitant use study with Adacel and Menactra
(B1971015). These four studies were postmarketing requirements or
commitments under the original approval of the three-dose schedule (a dose
administered according to a 0, 2, and 6 month schedule).
2. Background
Trumenba is a bivalent meningococcal group B vaccine that contains two factor H
binding proteins (fHBP) from Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis)
serogroup B. fHBP is a conserved, outer membrane lipoprotein and a virulence
factor that contributes to the ability of the bacteria to avoid host defenses.
On June 16, 2014, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (U.S. license 0003), a subsidiary
of Pfizer Inc., submitted BLA 125549 for licensure of Meningococcal Group B
Vaccine (Trumenba). Trumenba was approved on October 29, 2014, under the
accelerated approval regulations (21 CFR 601.4o-46) for active immunization to
prevent invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroup B in individuals 10
through 25 years of age. Under this approval, the Applicant was required to
conduct adequate and well-controlled studies (B1971009 and B1971016) to verify
and describe the clinical benefit attributable to this product by demonstration of
effectiveness against diverse meningococcal group B strains. Additionally, the
Applicant was required to conduct three pediatric studies and committed to
conducting three postmarketing studies: to further describe the safety of
Trumenba in persons 10 years to less than 26 years of age (B1971014), to assess
the concomitant use of Trumenba with Menactra and Adacel and in persons 10
2

years to less than 13 years of age (B1971015) and a cohort study to examine
pregnancy and birth outcomes following vaccination with Trumenba prior to or
during pregnancy (B1971052).
On March 27, 2015, the Applicant submitted a Clinical Efficacy Supplement (STN
125549/17) to revise the dosing regimen. The FDA approved the supplement on
April 14, 2016, to include a two-dose schedule (a dose administered at 0 and 6
months) under the regulations for accelerated approval, 21 CFR 601.40-46. The
approval also included a modification of the three-dose schedule (that had been
approved under the original BLA according to the regulations for accelerated
approval) from administration at 0, 2, and 6 months to administration at 0, 1-2,
and 6 months.
3. Clinical/Statistical/Pharmacovigilance
a) Clinical Program
(Extracted in part from Dr. Tina Chang’s clinical review)
This supplement contains clinical data from four studies (B1971009,
B1971016, B1971014 and B1971015) that were ongoing at the time of the
original Trumenba BLA approval.
•

Studies B1971009 and B1971016 were confirmatory Phase 3 studies
that were conducted in subjects 10 to <18 years of age and 18 to <26
years of age, respectively, as postmarketing requirements (PMRs)
for accelerated approval of the Trumenba three-dose schedule (0, 2,
and 6 months). Lot consistency was also evaluated as part of study
B1971009.

•

Study B1971014 was a Phase 3 safety study conducted in persons 10
years to <26 years of age.

•

Study B1971015 was a Phase 2 study that assessed concomitant use
of Trumenba with Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, and W-135)
Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4) and
Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis
Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap) in persons 10 years to <13 years of age.

All four studies, B1971009, B1971016, B1971014, and B1971015, were
randomized, controlled, observer-blinded studies. Study B1971014
evaluated only safety while the other three studies evaluated safety and
immunogenicity. Additionally, studies B1971009 and B1971016 were
conducted in the U.S., Canada and Europe, study B1971014 was conducted
in the U.S. and Europe, and study B1971015 was conducted only in the
U.S.

Immunogenicity
The effectiveness of Trumenba against diverse N. meningitidis serogroup
B strains was inferred by human serum bactericidal activity (hSBA)
responses using 14 test strains (four primary strains and 10 secondary
strains) in the two confirmatory Phase 3 studies. As mentioned above,
these studies were ongoing at the time the original Trumenba BLA was
approved and conducted with the original three-dose schedule (a dose
administered at 0, 2, and 6 months). These studies confirmed the
effectiveness through an evaluation using the same four diverse strains
that were evaluated in the Phase 2 studies reviewed under the original BLA
as well as a further description of responses to an additional 10 strains to
confirm breadth of coverage of the vaccine against this panel of diverse
strains. The primary objectives and analyses for the Phase 3 studies were
to assess the hSBA response to each primary strain and to all of the
primary strains to provide pivotal evidence of effectiveness. We consider
these studies as adequately designed for confirmation of effectiveness to
support traditional approval of the vaccine.

4

Primary strains:
Evaluation of hSBA responses using four primary meningococcal
serogroup B (MenB) strains expressing variants A22, A56, B24 and B44
was the primary objective for the confirmatory studies. The selection of
the four primary strains included the most prevalent fHBP variants from
each family in the U.S. (A22 and B24). The two additional primary strains
represent genetically diverse fHBP variants. The five co-primary
endpoints and corresponding data are summarized below. The prespecified primary immunogenicity endpoints were met in both studies.

hSBA = serum bactericidal assay using human complement; N= the number of subjects with valid
and determinate hSBA titers for the given strain at both the specified time point and baseline;
LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; CI = confidence interval
Note: LLOQ = 1:16 for A22; 1:8 for A56, B24, and B44.
a The strains expressing variant A22, A56, B24, and B44 correspond to strains PMB80, PMB2001,
PMB2948, and PMB2707, respectively.
b ≥4-fold increase in hSBA titer: %=n/N = number of subjects with a hSBA fold rise ≥4 from
baseline (pre-Vaccination #1) for the given strain/ number of subjects with valid and determinate
hSBA titers for the given strain at both the specified time point and baseline. A ≥4-fold increase in
hSBA titer is defined as follows: (1) For subjects with a baseline hSBA titer <1:4, a response was
defined as an hSBA titer ≥1:16. (2) For subjects with a baseline hSBA titer ≥1:4, a 4-fold response

5

was defined as an hSBA titer ≥4 times the LLOQ or ≥4 times the baseline titer, whichever was
higher.
c Composite hSBA response (hSBA ≥ LLOQ for all four primary strains: %=n/N = number of
subjects with observed hSBA titer ≥ LLOQ for all four primary strains at the given time point/
number of subjects with valid and determinate hSBA results on all four strains at the given time
point.
d If the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than the corresponding threshold, the immunogenicity
objective with respect to that endpoint is achieved. The primary study objective requires this
criterion to be met for all five co-primary endpoints.

Secondary strains:
hSBA responses against the following 10 diverse meningococcal group B
strains (secondary strains) was a descriptive, secondary objective in the
two Phase 3 confirmatory studies: PMB3010 (A06), PMB3040 (A07),
PMB824 (A12), PMB1672 (A15), PMB1989 (A19), PMB3175 (A29),
PMB1256 (B03), PMB866 (B09), PMB431 (B15), and PMB648 (B16). The
descriptive assessment of serum bactericidal antibodies against these
additional strains further describes effectiveness against circulating strains
expressing protein variants that differ from the primary strains.
For subjects 10 to <18 years of age (study B1971009), the proportion of
subjects with a hSBA titer ≥LLOQ one month after Vaccination #3 with
Trumenba were 76.1% to 98.9% for U.S. subjects and 75.1% to 98.6% for
all subjects (U.S. and Europe), depending on the strain. For subjects 18 to
<26 years of age (study B1971016), the proportion of subjects with a hSBA
titer ≥LLOQ one month after Vaccination #3 with Trumenba was 66.7% to
98.8% for U.S. subjects and 71.3% to 99.3% for all subjects (U.S. and
Europe), depending on the strain.
The hSBA responses to primary strains were not necessarily predictive of
responses to secondary strains. Overall, the immunogenicity data from
B1971009 and B1971016 verify and further describe the clinical benefit of
Trumenba administered as a three-dose series (o, 1-2, and 6 months), to
induce bactericidal antibodies against diverse MenB strains.
Lot consistency
The lot consistency was evaluated in study B1971009 and the objective was
met. The 2-sided 95% CIs on the hSBA GMT ratios between any 2 of the 3
Trumenba lots using MenB strains PMB80 (A22) and PMB2948 (B24)
were tested with a 2-fold margin and the results were within the prespecified interval (0.5, 2.0), one month after Vaccination #3.
Concomitant vaccination
No immunological interference with meningococcal hSBA responses was
observed when Trumenba was administered concomitantly with Menactra
and Adacel vaccines compared to hSBA responses when Trumenba was
6

administered alone (study B1971015). Immune responses were evaluated
by comparisons of GMTs for each of the Menactra and Adacel antigens one
month after the first Trumenba vaccination, and hSBA GMTs using two
MenB strains (variants A22 and B24) one month after the third Trumenba
vaccination. The non-inferiority criteria for the comparisons of GMTs
(lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio (Group 1/Group 3 for
MenB strains and Group 1/Group 2 for MCV4 and Tdap) > 0.67) were met
for all antigens.
Clinical serology assays
The performance of each serological assay was evaluated and deemed
appropriate for its intended use in the studies submitted to this
application.
•
•
•

The primary strains were validated and the secondary strains were
qualified for the hSBA assays.
Serum bactericidal assays (using (b) (4) complement (rSBA) and the
(b) (4)
IgG assay) were used to assess the responses to the
polysaccharides in Menactra.
The (b) (4) IgG assay was used to quantitate antibodies against
pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin
(PRN) and fimbriae (FIM) to assess the responses to the
polysaccharides in Adacel.

Statistical
There were no major statistical issues related to the submission. Primary
results were confirmed by independent analyses from the statistical
reviewer. The pre-specified immunogenicity objectives in the studies
were met and supported the approval of the vaccine.

(Extracted in part from Dr. Tina Chang’s clinical review)
The safety of Trumenba was evaluated in four randomized, controlled studies
(B1971009, B1971016, B1971014, and B1971015) in this supplement. A total of
10,718 subjects received at least one dose of Trumenba and 4,497 subjects were
included in control groups. The control group in studies B1971009 and B1971014
received hepatitis A virus vaccine (at 0 and 6 months) and saline (at 2 months).
The control group in study B1971016 received 3 saline injections (at 0, 2 and 6
months). In study B1971015, Group 2 received 3 saline injections (at 0, 2, and 6
months) with Menactra and Adacel at 0 months. Solicited local reactions and
systemic events were recorded on an e-diary in all studies except in the phase 3
study B1971014. Because the purpose of study B1971014 was to detect rare safety
events, e-diaries were not used; therefore, reactogenicity events were reported as
unsolicited adverse events (AEs).
Among the 10,718 subjects who received at least one dose of Trumenba, 48.0% of
subjects were male and 84.3% were Caucasian, 11.6% were African-American,
1.4% were Asian, and 2.7% were characterized as “other.”
In general, Trumenba was more reactogenic than the comparator (saline,
HAV/saline or Menactra +Adacel, depending on the study) for local adverse
reactions and systemic adverse reactions. The most common solicited adverse
reactions in adolescents and young adults that occurred in ≥30% were pain at the
injection site (≥85%), fatigue (≥60%), headache (≥55%) and muscle pain (≥35%).
In study B1971009, the proportion of subjects reporting AEs that led to study
withdrawal was 0.82% in the combined Trumenba groups (receiving lots 1, 2 and
3) and 0.33% in the HAV/saline group. In study B1971016, the proportion of
subjects reporting AEs that led to study withdrawal was 1.01% in the Trumenba
group and 0.73% in the saline group. In study B1971014, the proportion of
subjects reporting AEs that led to study withdrawal was 1.19% in the Trumenba
group and 0.52% in the HAV/Saline group. In study B1971015, the proportion of
subjects reporting AEs that led to study withdrawal was 1.4% in Group 1
(Menactra+Adacel+Trumenba) 0.6% in Group 2 (Menactra+Adacel+saline), and
0.7% in Group 3 (saline+saline+Trumenba).
The percentage of subjects with at least 1 SAE occurring during the time period
from the first study vaccination through 6 months after last study vaccination
was 1.89% in the HAV/saline group and 2.45% in the combined Trumenba
groups in study B1971009 and 1.34% in the Trumenba group and 1.34% in the
saline group for study B1971016. In study B1971014, 1.55% of subjects in Group 1
8

and 2.52% subjects in Group 2 reported serious adverse events (SAEs)
throughout the study. In study B1971009 and B1971015, none of the SAEs were
assessed as related to study vaccination by the investigators. In study B1971016,
there were 3 (0.12%) SAEs (pyrexia, multiple sclerosis, and dystonia) in the
Trumenba group and no SAEs in the saline group that were assessed as possibly
related to study vaccination by the investigators. In study B1971014, there were 2
(0.05%) SAEs (neutropenia and anaphylactic reaction) in the Trumenba group
and 2 (0.10%) SAEs (demyelination and spontaneous abortion) in HAV/saline
group that were assessed as possibly related to study vaccination by the
investigators.
Solicited local reactions within 7 days of vaccination
In adolescents in study B1971009, subjects in the combined Trumenba group
(Lots #1-3) (93.0%) reported more local reactions than subjects receiving either
HAV or saline (58.8%). Pain at the injection site was the most commonly
reported local reaction and was reported in a higher proportion of subjects in the
combined Trumenba group compared to the HAV/saline group after Vaccination
#1 (86.7% and 47.0%, respectively), Vaccination #2 (77.7% and 15.2%,
respectively), and Vaccination #3 (76.0% and 34.0%, respectively). Most cases
were mild to moderate in severity. Redness at the injection site was reported in a
higher proportion of subjects in the combined Trumenba group compared to the
HAV/saline group after Vaccination #1 (16.2% and 1.3%, respectively),
Vaccination #2 (12.5% and 0.6%, respectively), and Vaccination #3 (13.9% and
1.1%, respectively). Swelling at the injection site was reported in a higher
proportion of subjects in the combined Trumenba group compared to the
HAV/saline group after Vaccination #1 (18.0% and 2.2%, respectively),
Vaccination #2 (13.9% and 0.6%, respectively), and Vaccination #3 (15.4% and
0.9%, respectively). In Study 1, mean duration of pain was 2.4 to 2.6 days (range
1-17 days), for redness 2.0 to 2.2 days (range 1-12 days) and for swelling 2.0 to 2.1
days (range 1-21 days) in the combined Trumenba group.
In young adults in study B1971016, subjects in the Trumenba group (90.0%)
reported more local reactions within 7 days after each vaccination than subjects
receiving saline (19.2%). Again, pain at the injection site was the most commonly
reported local reaction and was reported in a higher proportion of subjects in the
Trumenba group compared to the saline group after Vaccination #1 (84.2% and
11.8%, respectively), Vaccination #2 (79.3% and 7.8%, respectively), and
Vaccination #3 (80.4% and 6.7%, respectively). Most cases were mild to
moderate in severity. Redness at the injection site was reported in a higher
proportion of subjects in Group 1 compared to Group 2 after Vaccination #1
(13.8% and 0.6%), Vaccination #2 (11.8% and 0.3%), and Vaccination #3 (17.1%
and 0.2%). Swelling at the injection site was reported in a higher proportion of
subjects in Group 1 compared to Group 2 after Vaccination #1 (15.5% and 0.6%),
Vaccination #2 (14.0% and 0.4%), and Vaccination #3 (16.6% and 0.3%). In
Study 2, mean duration of pain was 2.6 to 2.8 days (range 1-67 days), for redness

9

2.2 to 2.5 days (range 1-13 days) and for swelling 2.1 to 2.6 days (range 1-70 days)
in the Trumenba group.
Solicited systemic reaction within 7 days of vaccination
In adolescents in study B1971009, a higher proportion of subjects in the
combined Trumenba group reported any systemic events within 7 days compared
to the HAV/saline group after Vaccination #1 (74.2% vs 60.4%, respectively),
Vaccination #2 (59.4% vs 42.7%, respectively) and Vaccination #3 (55.7% vs
41.4%, respectively). A higher proportion of subjects reported systemic events
after Vaccination #1 in the combined Trumenba group compared to the
HAV/saline group (the control group received an injection of HAV) for fever
(6.4% vs 1.9%), headache (51.8% vs 37.2%), fatigue (54.0% vs 40.3%), chills
(25.3% vs 17.2%), muscle pain (24.4% vs 19.2%), joint pain (21.9% vs 13.6%), and
a similar proportion of subjects reported vomiting (3.7% vs 1.9%) and diarrhea
(10.6% vs 12.1%). After Vaccination #2, a higher proportion of systemic events
was observed for the combined Trumenba group compared to the HAV/saline
group (the control group received an injection of saline) for headache (37.8% vs
28.1%), fatigue (38.3% vs 26.3%), chills (16.0% vs 10.3%), muscle pain (17.8% vs
10.3%), and joint pain (16.7% vs 9.1%) and a similar proportion for fever (2.0% vs
1.5%), vomiting (2.2% vs 1.4%) and diarrhea (7.6% vs 9.1%). After Vaccination
#3, a higher proportion of systemic events was observed for the combined
Trumenba group compared to the HAV/saline group (the control group received
an injection of HAV) for headache (35.4% vs 24.8%), fatigue (35.9% vs 24.4%),
chills (13.1% vs 8.3%), muscle pain (17.6% vs 11.1%), joint pain (16.0% vs 8.9%),
and a similar proportion for fever (2.7% vs 2.3%), vomiting (1.7% vs 2.2%), and
diarrhea (7.7% vs 7.6%). Headache and fatigue were the most commonly
reported systemic events in both groups. Overall a low rate of fever and a low
rate of antipyretic use were reported in subjects receiving Trumenba and subjects
receiving HAV vaccine/saline. The mean duration of systemic events was
generally similar between the subjects receiving Trumenba and subjects receiving
HAV/saline.
In young adults in study B1971016, a higher proportion of subjects in the
Trumenba group reported any systemic events within 7 days compared to the
saline group after Vaccination #1 (71.6% vs 60.5%, respectively), Vaccination #2
(56.8% vs 43.6%, respectively) and Vaccination #3 (56.9% vs 36.7%, respectively).
Fatigue and headache were the most frequently reported systemic events in
Group 1 and Group 2. After Vaccination #1, a higher incidence of systemic events
was observed for Group 1 compared with Group 2 for headache (43.9% vs 36.2%),
fatigue (50.9% vs 39.8%), chills (18.1% vs 9.8%), muscle pain (25.9% vs 14.5%),
and joint pain (19.6% vs 10.9%). After Vaccination #2, a higher incidence of
systemic events was observed for Group 1 compared with Group 2 for headache
(33.1% vs 24.9%), fatigue (39.2% vs 27.3%), chills (12.4% vs 8.5%), muscle pain
(15.6% vs 8.5%), and joint pain (15.1% vs 6.5%). After Vaccination #3, a higher
incidence of systemic events was observed for Group 1 compared with Group 2
for fever (2.0% vs 0.6%), headache (32.5% vs 21.6%), fatigue (39.3% vs 24.5%),

chills (12.6% vs 6.4%), muscle pain (16.9% vs 7.5%), and joint pain (12.6% vs
5.3%). Overall, a low rate of fever and a low rate of antipyretic use were reported
in subjects from Group 1 and 2 (2.7% and 0.6%, respectively). The mean
durations of systemic events were generally similar between the subjects in
Group 1 and Group 2.
Autoimmune and neuroinflammatory conditions
Twelve of 10,718 subjects (0.11%) who received Trumenba reported an
autoimmune condition and 7 of 10,718 (0.07%) Trumenba recipients reported a
neuroinflammatory condition. Six of 4,497 (0.13%) subjects categorized as
controls reported an autoimmune condition and 4 of 4497 (0.09%) subjects
categorized as controls reported a neuroinflammatory condition for comparison.
Based on clinical review of individual cases, there was no conclusive evidence of
excess risk of autoimmune or neuroinflammatory conditions among the overall
population of Trumenba recipients. Five of the 12 subjects with autoimmune
conditions had evidence of pre-existing disease prior to vaccination with
Trumenba. In all, autoimmune and neuroinflammatory conditions reported in
Trumenba recipients did not suggest a pattern of a common pathophysiological
mechanism.
8. Advisory Committee Meeting
A Vaccines and Related Biologics Products Advisory Committee meeting was not
held for this supplement, as there were no issues or concerns that presented
during the course of review of the supplement that required consult from the
advisory committee.
9. Other Relevant Regulatory Issues
The two-dose schedule (a dose administered at 0 and 6 months) was approved on
April 14, 2016, also under the accelerated approval regulations. As both the twodose and three-dose schedules are mentioned in the package insert (PI), it is
important to refer to the specific schedule that is being confirmed under this
supplement (as the two-dose schedule has yet to be verified and further
described).
The Applicant submitted post-dose 2 clinical data obtained after month two
within the three-dose schedule. However, because this supplement was to
confirm the original three-dose schedule, the immunogenicity data obtained after
the second dose were not incorporated into the Trumenba PI. Only
immunogenicity data obtained after the final dose in the series were included in
the PI.

10. Labeling
(Extracted in part from Dr. Tina Chang’s clinical review)
During the review of this supplement, changes were made to the following
sections of the Trumenba PI: Dosage and Administration (2.0), Adverse
Reactions (6.0), Clinical Trials Experience (6.1), Pregnancy (8.1), Lactation (8.2),
Immunogenicity (14.1), and Concomitant Vaccine Administration (14.2). No
changes were made to the carton and container labeling. The notable changes in
the specific subsections are described below.
The following statement was added under the Dosage and Administration section
to provide guidance regarding the two-dose schedule: “If the second dose is
administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should be
administered at least 4 months after the second dose.” Revisions were made to
the Adverse Reactions section to describe the most common solicited adverse
reactions in adolescents and young adults (from studies B1971009 and B1971016).
The safety results of two Phase 3 confirmatory studies (B1971009 and B1971016)
replaced the Phase 2 data in the Clinical Trials Experience section (i.e., four new
tables containing local and systemic adverse reactions replaced two comparable
tables). Revisions were made to the Pregnancy and Lactation sections to be
compliant with the format established by the 2014 Pregnancy and Lactation
Labeling (PLLR) rule. The immunogenicity results of two Phase 3 confirmatory
studies replaced the Phase 2 data in the Immunogenicity section (i.e., two new
tables containing immunogenicity data replaced a comparable table). Additional
descriptive information was added in the Concomitant Vaccine Administration
section to describe 1) study 4 (B1971011) with respect to the administration of
Trumenba with Gardasil that was reviewed under the original BLA and 2) study 5
(B1971015) with respect to the administration of Trumenba with Menactra and
Adacel that was reviewed under this supplement. The final draft PI dated March
10, 2017, was reviewed by the review committee and found to be acceptable.
11. Recommendations and Risk/Benefit Assessment
a) Recommended Regulatory Action
The immunogenicity data from two confirmatory clinical studies B1971009
and B1971016 confirm the clinical benefit of Trumenba for the primary
strains and the breadth of coverage against a panel of diverse
meningococcal group B strains. Thus, this supplement supports a
recommendation for conversion of the Trumenba three-dose schedule
(administered at 0, 1-2, and 6 months) from accelerated approval status to
traditional approval, and removal of the following language from the
highlights section of the PI: “the effectiveness of Trumenba against diverse
serogroup B strains has not been confirmed.” In contrast, since the twodose schedule (a dose administered at 0 and 6 months) is still approved
under the accelerated approval regulations, the following language will be
12

retained in the highlights section of the PI: “The effectiveness of the twodose schedule of Trumenba against diverse N. meningitidis serogroup B
strains has not been confirmed.”
b) Risk/Benefit Assessment
The risk/benefit assessment of the three dose schedule of Trumenba is
unchanged.
c) Recommendation for Postmarketing Activities
The review team made a determination that no new postmarketing
commitments or postmarketing requirements were needed.
