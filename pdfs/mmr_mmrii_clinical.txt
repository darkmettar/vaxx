Studies of Combined Live
(RA 27/3) Virus Vaccine

Background
On January 11, 1978, we submitted "Summary No. 2 of Clinical
Investigative
Studies of RA 27/3 Strain Live Rubella Virus Vaccine for Support for
a License to Manufacture and Sell" to the Bureau.
That summary showed
the RA 27 /3 rubella
virus vaccine to be safe and highly effective
in
inducing rubella
hemagglutination-inhibition
(HI) antibodies
in persons
of various ages.
In extension
of clinical
tests with RA 27/3 strain
rubella
virus vaccine,
studies
were conducted to evaluate
its immunizing capability
when combined with live attenuated
Moraten line measles virus vaccine (ATTENUVAX)
and Jeryl Lynn mumps virus vaccine (MUMPSVAX). The present submission
relates
to clinical
investigative
studies
of combined live measle smumps-rubella
(RA 27/3) virus vaccine.

Study Summaries

Reference 1 - Study 442 - Dr. Victor Villarejos
Details
of the study plan are given in the clinical
test protocol.
The
study was designed to measure antibody and clinical
responses
to the
RA 27/3 rub ella component when given alone or combined with mumps and/or
measles vaccine.
Findings presented
in the summary tables indicate
excellent
antibody response to all components among children
receivinf
live measles-mumps-rubella
(RA 27/3) virus vaccine.
No untoward clinical
reactions
were noted following vaccination.
Reference 2 - Study 443 - Dr. Robert Weibel
Details
of the study plan are presented
in the clinical
protocol.
The
purpose of the study was to measure antibody and clinical
responses
to
the RA 27/3 rubella
component when given alone or combined with measles
and mumps virus components.
Findings are presented
in the summary tables.
Each of the three viruses produced excellent
antibody responses
when
administered
in combined form.
Both vaccines were well tolerated.
Reference 3 - Study 459 - Dr. Stephen Lerman
Study 459 is being conducted in children
to compare responses
to HPV-77
and RA 27/3 rubella
vaccines when given alone or combined with measles
and mumps vaccines.
Details
of the study plan are given in the clinical
test protocol.
Preliminary
findings
presented
in the summary tables
show excellent
antibody response to measles, mumps, and rubella
components
and lack of suppression
when the three viruses
are combined.
Reaction rates
were as expected.
Reference 4 - Study 467 - Dr. Robert Weibel
Study 467 was conducted among children
to compare responses
to combined
measles-mumps-rubella
vaccines
containing
either
the HPV-77 or RA 27/3
rubella
component.
Details
of the study plan are given in the clinical
test protocol,
and study results
are presented
in the summary tables.
Antibody responses

the
HPV- 77 or RA 27 /3 rubella
component.
Preliminary
findings
are prese n ted
in the report from Dr. Gershon.
The study continues
in progress.
Reference 7 - Study 511 - Dr . Victor Villarejos
Study 511 was conducted to measure antibody and clinical
responses
to
three consecutive
lots of combined measles-mumps-rubella
vaccine
containing
the RA 27/3 rubella
component.
Details
of the study plan
are given in the clinical
test protocol,
and study results
are presented
in the summary tables.
Responses to the rubella
component were excellent
Seroconversion
rates
for measles and mumps were somewhat lower than
expected,
and the decreased
seroconversion
rates were attributed
to
some overheating
of the vaccine during transport
in the field.
Reaction
rates were comparable among the lots.
Reference 8 - Study 513 - Dr. Robert Weibel
Study 513 is being conducted
to measure antibody and clinical
responses
to three consecutive
lots of combined measles-mumps-ruhella
vaccine
containing
the RA 27/3 rubella
component.
Study details
are given in
the clinical
protocol,
and preliminary
findings
are given in the summary

t.'~di cal Opinion
Fer 15 months 194 children (ages 10 months to 8 years) from the open population were enrolled in
this study at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,
Philadelphia,
Pennsy lvania; Darby Health Clinic,
C:iroy, Pennsylvania; and Dr. G. Starkweather's office, Havertown, Penmylvania.
Informed consent
wos obtained from the parent for each child and a blood sample was obtained from 184 children
initially and approximately 6 weeks later . All vaccine was given subcutaneously in the arm. One
h:..:-icred and hvo child re n (mean 1.7 years} received 0.5 ml. M-M-R; 3 (mean 2.7 years} received
1.0 ml . M - M- R; and 89 children (mean 1. 9 years) received 0.5 ml. rubella vaccine.
All but 12
p::~ents returned report cords with doily temperatures and clinical observations for 42 d:::iysfollowing
c=::iinistiation of the vaccine.
Parent s were instructed to report high fevers and rash by telephone to
R. E. W. and on follow-up were queired -on recorded observations for greater detail.
1

,:-:,orig susceptible and immune vaccinees te mpera t ure elevations were scattered randomly th roughout
tf-.: cSservotion period with no greater association with either vaccine.
Most temperature elevations
p~cSobly reflect unrelated infection occurring among the voccinees at various time periods.
Upper
res?iratory and gastrointestinal
in fections were reported in about 55% and 40% of voccinees respecti ve ly . Temperatur es were not record e d on approximately
10% of the vaccinees.
A faint measleslik: rash occurred in 9 triple susceptible children receiving M-M-R and 3 ausceptibles receiving rubella
vcccine alone.
Mild transient orthrolgio was reported by the parent but not observed by a medical
p-=;5on in one M-M-R susceptible voccinee, age 12 months, on day 17-20 (4 days); and one rubella
sus::eptible voccinee age 5 years on day one and 30 (2 days). N o arthritis or adverse clinical reaction
wc,. reported.

Of 68 children initially susceptible to measles-mumps-rubella
receiving 0.5 ml. M-M-R vaccine 94%,
96~~, and 100% respectively,
res ponded serologically with geometric mean titers as follows: measles
(HI) 57.0; mumps (neut.) 8.2; and rubella (HI} 136 .1. All 67 rubella susceptible vaccinees responded
serologically with a geometric mean hemagglu ti notion titer equal to or greater than 159.1. Of the
three children receiving 1.0 ml. M-M-R, all susce ptibles responded, howe ver, one was initially
i~::-:u,"le to M-M-R and one to mumps.
Ser~.::onv ersion of susceptible children to rube Ila vaccine alone or in combined M-M-R was 100%
wit:i comparable hemog g lutinot ion inhibiting geometric mean titers.
Seroconversion rotes and geometric
rr.ec:i titers to measles and mumps vaccine following M- M-R (RA 27/3) ore similar to th ose following
M-i'-, ',-R (HPV-77) reported in earlier studies . live RA 27 /3 rube I la virus vaccine alone or combined
h live measles and li ve mumps virus vaccine induced measureable antibodies in all rubella susceptible
vccdnees with no significant clinical reacti on .

Significant
differences
in seroconversion
rates for measles,
mu~ps ,
and rubella
and clinical
reaction
rates among three groups of
vaccinees
were investigated.
The groups were those who received
a 0.5 ml dose of co~bined live measles-mumps - rubella
(RA 27/3)
virus vaccine
(Group 1), those who received
a 1.0 ml dose of the
same (Group 2), and those who received
a 0.5 ml dose of combined
live measles-mumps-rubella
(HPV-77) virus vaccine
(Group 3).
Significant
differenc e exists
in the mumps seroconversion
rate
among these groups.
56 ou t of 57 (98 . 2%) converted
in Group 1,
11 out of 11 (100. 0%) in Group 2, and 50 out of 58 (86. 2%) in
Group 3 , No significant
diff~rences
exist for other rates.
Analysis
of variance
was performed on post-titer
values of triplenegative
vaccinees . The lo g transformation
was used.
Significant
differences
among the groups existed
for all three components.
Multiple
comparisons
showed the following:
a)

For measles,
children
in Group 2 (G: IT = 254 . 0) had significantly
gr ea ter post tit er (in the log scale)
than did those in Group 1
(GHT = 56 . 2) and those in Group 3 (GMT= 51.1);

b) For mumps, children
in Group 1 (GMT= 8 . 3) had significantly
greater
post titer
than did those in Group 2 (GHT = 4.3)
and those in Group 3 ( G"t>'IT
= 5 • 0) ;
c) for rubella,
children
in Group 1 (G~IT = 131.7) and Group 2
(GMT= 256.0) had significantly
greater
post titer
than did
those in Group 3 (GMT= 32.4).

M.D. 1s office, Havertown, Po.; 275 child ren ,
10 months to seven years of age were enrol led in this study with parental consent.
Two-hundred fifty five children received a O. 5 ml. subcutaneous dose of either vaccine.
Inadvertently,
twenty ch il dren
received a 1.0 ml . subcutaneous dose of combined measles - mumps-rube Ila (RA 27/ 3) virus vaccine.
Each child received a report card and the parents were encouraged t o record local and systemic reactions
for 42 days . Paired b lood samples were obtained prior to and 6 weeks fol lwing vaccination from 148 of
275 (54%) children to perform measles hemagglutination
inhibitionJmumps neutralization
end rubella
hemaggl utinotion inhibition tests.
Measles-mumps-rubella
(RA 27/3) virus vaccine was given to 137 children, ages 11 months to 7 years
(mean age 1.9 years) with 78 paired sere, seropositive to m-m-r in two and seronegative as follows:
m-m-r 58, measles-rube I la 5, mumps-rube I la 3, mumps 7, rube I la 3 - 13 m-m-r seronegatives hod
only a pre-injection
serology test . Measles-mumps-rube Ila (HPV-77) virus vaccine was given to 138
children, ages 10 months to seven years (mean age 1,7 years) with 70 paired sere serapositive to m-m-r
in 2 and seronegotive as fol lows: m-m-r 53, measles-rube I la 9, mumps- rube I la 2, measles 1, mumps 3 -17
m-m-r seronegotive , had only a pre-injection
serology tested.
Seroconversion rates fo r triple seronegatives were similar to the overall seroconversion rates which ore as follows wi th the geometric mean
titers: m-m-r (RA 27/3) vaccine 0.5 ml. dose; measles 49/53 (92.5%, 56 , 2); mumps 56/ 57 (98% , 8.3);
rubella 59/59 (100%, 131.7); m-m - r RA 27/ 3 vaccine - 1. 0 dose; measles 10/ 10 (254); mumps 11/11 (4 . 37); rubel lo 10/ 10 all 100% (256); m-m-r HPV-77 vaccine 0 , 5 ml. dose; measles 56 / 63 (88. 9%,
51. 1); mumps 50/ 58 (86. 2%, 50) rube Ilo 60/ 64 (98 .8%, 32.4) .

-2Medi col Opini on (cont. )
The seroconversion rote s and geometric mean titers ore greater following 0.5 ml. m-m - r RA 27/ 3
than 0.5 ml. m-m-r HPVos follows: measles - 92 . 5% vs. 88.8 % , 56.2 vs. 51.1; mumps - 98 .2 <:c.
vs 86 . 2%, 8.3 vs.· 5.0; rubella - 100% vs. 93.8%, 131.7 vs. 32 . 4. The difference in the mumps
seroconversion rotes, mumps geometric mean titers and rube I lo geometric mean titers ore stotistic:il ly
signifi cant . Int erestingly, all (11) measles vaccine failures were less than 15 months of age (2- 11,
6-12, 2 -13, 1-14 months ) and may be related to the persistence of maternal antib ody. This patte rn
was not observed in previous studies.
Two of 4 rubella failures (13 months) and 4 of 8 mumps failures
were less than 15 months old (l-11, 2-12, 1-13 months.
Clinical report cards were returned on 202 of 275 (73%) of vaccinees with nosig nif icont vaccine related
clinical reaction reported . Temperature elevations were similar among both vaccine groups with no
defini te pattern during the observation period. Most temperature elevations ore related to intercur rent
infection with minima I vaccine related fever occurring between days 5 and 12. Injecti on site soreness
was rarely reported in each group. Measles-I ike rash was reported in m-m-r RA 27 / 3 voccinees as
follows: 0.5 ml. - 7, 1.0 ml. -l, and in 5 m-m-r HPV vaccinees.
No arthralgia or arthritis were
reported.
Lymphadenopothy was reported by 4 m-m-r RA 27/ 3 voccinees o~ly. Non - specific
complaints were simi far in both groups.
Com paring combined m-m-r RA 27/3 vaccine with m-m-r HPV-77 vaccine reveals no difference in
the mild clinical complaints and temperature elevations reported but a greater seroconversion rate
an d geometric mean titer to all three viruses following m-m - r RA 27/ 3 vaccine.
Although both
vaccines ore excellent for immunization, m-m-r RA 27/3 combined vaccine is superior and recommended.

VACCINE

In the United St~tes,
measles,
mumps and ruoella
(German ~easles)
va==ine should be given to baoies
between the ages of 12 months 15 !~Onths.
These va::::-ines are i.mportant: be=ause they . provide
l)aoies
::lnd ::hildren
wi. ·:h ~-onq-lastinq
itMmni ty to :nea~ le~. r;ii.1rr.ps
ana ru~ella
(German measl~s).

l

I

Many =lini=s
are now giiing
babies
a oombined measles-mumps-rubella
va:=cine in one inje=tion.
Our clinic
has re=ently
received
a new
vaccine which contains
regular
measles-mumps
vaccine
combi ned wit:h
a new, unli=cnsed
rubella
va:=cine called
RA-27.
This RA-27 va=::ine
has been ~sed experimentally
in many =hildren
(in Europe)
and it
seems to produ:::e better
antibodies
th~n the one which is now licensed
for use in the United States.
Our study is designed
to see how good this experimental
rubella
AA-27
vac:::ine really
is.
It is combined wi-:h the measles-mumps
va::=ine so
that your ~hild will only have to have one injection.
We will also
have to obtain a small sample of blood (5 ml or about a teaspoonful)
before
~nd eight weeks after
the vaccine
is given.
The known side effe:::ts
of this type of vaccine
are very few and occur
only rarely
in children.
The side effects
are fever,
rash,
and joint
pain . Should any of these c::~ur they will disappear
after
a few days
without
any treatment.

If you would like your child to receive
the measles-m~mps-RA-27-rubell
va:==ine you should sign this sheet in the space provided
for your
signature.
Your child does not have ~o participate
in this
study
if you ao not want him (her) to.
In that case your child
should
receive
rcgul~r
measles-mumps-rubella
vaccine
in our clinic.
Should
you d~cidc to have your child participate
in this st~dy,
his (her)
participation
will be kept strictly
confidential

Analyses of variance were performed on post-titer
values of children
who were initially

components . The
log transformation
was used in each analysis.
No significant
differences exist among the groups (lots)

Preliminary
Statistical
Analysis
Mumps-Rubella Virus Vaccine

Date 2/6/78

- Study #513, Combined Live Measles -

Significant
differences
in seroconversion
rates for measles, mumps,
and rubella
and clinical
reaction
rates among vaccinees
receiving
three lots of combined live measles-mumps-rubella
vaccine were
investigated.
Lots of vaccine were:
Lot #60664/C -E810
Lot #60665/C-E811
Lot #60666/C-E812
A significant
difference
exists among the three lots in th e incidence
of non-specific
rash.
15 out of 53 exhibited
diaper,
heat , or contact
rash (28. 3%) who received Lot #60664/C-E810;
7 out of 54 (12. 9i.~ ·•1ho
received Lot #60665/C-EBll;
and 19 out of 56 (33.9%) who received
Lot #60666/C-E812.
No other rates were significant.
Analyses of variance were performed on post-titer
values of children
who were initially
seronegative
to the individual
components.
The
log transformation
was used in each analysis.
No significant
differences exist among the groups (lots)
for any of the three components.
A multivariate
analysis
was performed on the post-titer
values of
triple-negative
vaccinees.
Again, the log transformation
was
applied.
There was no significant
difference
among the groups.

Background
In a separate
submission,
"Summary No. 2 of Clinical
Investigative
Studies
of RA 27/3 Strain Live Rubella Virus Vaccine for Support of a License to
Manufacture and Sell,"
dated January 11, 1978, and in Addendum No. 1 to
that submission dated June 26, 1978, the RA 27/3 strain rubella
virus
vaccine was shown to be safe and highly effective
in eliciting
an antibody response in persons of various
ages.

In extension of clinical
tests with RA 27/3 rubella virus vaccine,
studies were conducted to evaluate
its immunizing capability
when
combined with live attenuated
Moraten measles virus vaccine
(ATTENUVAX)
.
The present
submission relates
to clinical
investigative
studies
of
combined live measles-rubella
(RA 27/3) virus vaccine .
All clinical
studies were conducted under
Measles-Rubella
(RA 27/3) Virus Vaccine.

The clinical
studies were carried out by the physicians
at the locations
in the individual
study summaries to follow.
The populations
employed
were defined with respect to age, location
and other pertinent
parameters.
Subjects were bled initially
and again 6 to 8 weeks later . The sera
were tested to define the initial
serostatus
and the subsequent antibody
response.
Clinical
surveillance
was by two procedures . In studies by Ors . Weibel
and Cooper, the observations
were recorded daily by the mother . The
parent was asked to contact the physician
should any significant
or
bothersome reaction
occur . In the studies by Dr. Villarejos,
observations were made on a routine basis by medical or paramedical
personnel;
physicians
were notified
of any significant
illness
which occurred
subsequent to vaccination .
The data presented
in the following sections
are self-explanatory
.
The detailed
background records are on file in Virus and Cell Biology
Research, Merck Institute
for Therapeutic
Research, West Point,
Pennsylvania.
These records are available
for review at any time .

rates among three
lots of combined measles-rubella
(RA 27/3) virus vaccine .
Multivariate
analysis
of variance was performed on post-titer
values for children who were initiall

to both
me asles and rubella
by the HI test . The log transformation
was used , While sample sizes were small, a significant
difference
exists between the measles HI titers

RE: Clinical Protocol - Study #514
Combined Live Measles-Rubella

Vaccine

Dear Arlene:
(b)(6)

At the conclusion of the first thirty voccinees
at Pediatric Associates
it was noted by Dr . Al Carlson that the lot number on the lost viol C-F022 did
not correspond with the lot required on the work sheet . After a thorough review
of the situation it con not be determined when the lot of vaccine not corresponding
to the record was given . This infor matio n must be considered in the evaluation of
al l clinical and serologic records from these vaccinees .
The fol lowi ng steps hove been token to prevent the recurrence

of this situation :

l . In addi tion to the col or code for eoch lot , as now used, the required
vaccine lot will be placed on the study reg ist ration shee t in the
re qui red col or of the Iot .
2 . Each lot wil I be placed in a separate color coded box rathe r than
in a single box with color coded areas as now used .
These changes have been instituted

to insure the accuracy

Sincerely,

receiving
three lots of combined measles-rubella
(RA 27/3) vaccine were
investigated.
Lots of vaccine were :
Lot #62343/C-F021
Lot #62344/C-F022
Lot #62345/C-F023

for any of

The groups (lots) were investigated
for statistical
differences
in post-vaccination
titer
among vaccinees
who were initially
seronegative
to both measles and rubella
by the HI test . Multivariate
analysis
of variance
was run in conjunction
with the
Kruskal-Wallis
k-sample test on the individual
components .
No significant
differences
could be determined among the three
lots of vaccine.
