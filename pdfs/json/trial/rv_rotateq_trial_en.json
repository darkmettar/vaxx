The trials demonstrated strong methodology including standardized adverse event collection, rigorous statistical analysis, and long-term follow-up through two rotavirus seasons. Minor limitations include lack of explicit double-blind documentation for all studies and absence of conflict of interest disclosures. Pre-term infants were studied separately, though immunocompromised populations were excluded."
