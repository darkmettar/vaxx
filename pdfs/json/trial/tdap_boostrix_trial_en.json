However, the main adolescent, adult, and elderly studies used active comparators: Td vaccine or another Tdap vaccine (ADACEL) rather than true placebo. The U.S. adolescent study compared BOOSTRIX (3,080) to Td vaccine (1,034). The adult study compared BOOSTRIX (1,522) to Tdap (762). The elderly study compared BOOSTRIX (887) to Td (445).",

Primary safety and immunogenicity trials in adolescents, adults, and elderly used active comparator vaccines (Td or Tdap), which limits the ability to detect vaccine-specific adverse events since both groups received immunogenic vaccines."

    "summary": "BOOSTRIX clinical trial program demonstrates adequate methodology with well-designed studies across multiple age groups (adolescents, adults, elderly, pregnant women) totaling over 9,000 subjects. Strengths include excellent age stratification, standardized adverse event collection with graded severity scales, appropriate statistical methods with pre-defined non-inferiority criteria, and comprehensive postmarketing surveillance. Key limitations include use of active comparators (Td/Tdap) rather than placebo in most studies which limits detection of vaccine-specific safety signals, observer-blinded rather than fully double-blinded design, and relatively short follow-up periods (6 months for SAEs). The pregnancy study notably used saline placebo. Important neurological risks (GBS, brachial neuritis) are acknowledged based on IOM findings. Missing elements include conflict of interest disclosures and explicit mortality data. Overall, the evidence base supports safety and immunogenicity for the indicated booster immunization indication."
