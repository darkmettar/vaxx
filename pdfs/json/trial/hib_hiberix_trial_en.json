Key methodological limitations include: (1) no true placebo control - all comparators were active vaccines; (2) extremely short follow-up for solicited events (4 days only); (3) open-label design in at least one major study; (4) no systematic monitoring for autoimmune conditions; (5) vulnerable populations (immunocompromised, premature infants) not systematically studied; (6) no mortality data reported; and (7) conflicts of interest not disclosed. The trial documented that one non-inferiority immunogenicity endpoint was not met (anti-PRP >=1.0 mcg/mL), demonstrating some transparency. Postmarketing surveillance has identified additional serious events including neurological complications. Overall, the evidence base meets minimum regulatory standards but has significant gaps for comprehensive safety assessment."
