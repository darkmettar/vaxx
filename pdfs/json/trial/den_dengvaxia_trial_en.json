The trials importantly identified a critical safety signal showing increased severe dengue risk in seronegative individuals (HR 3.94), leading to restricted indication. Areas for improvement include achieving full double-blinding (rather than observer-blind), more comprehensive autoimmune/neurological surveillance, and inclusion of conflict of interest disclosures. Overall, this represents a well-designed vaccine development program that successfully identified both efficacy in seropositive individuals and safety concerns in seronegative populations."
