Sample sizes are exemplary, particularly for pediatric populations (>6,000 children). Key limitations include: use of aluminum adjuvant as placebo rather than inert saline, short safety follow-up periods (5-14 days for most adverse events, 14-42 days for serious events), absence of systematic autoimmune/neurological monitoring in trials, no reported conflict of interest disclosures, and incomplete all-cause mortality reporting. Post-marketing surveillance has identified serious neurological events not detected in pre-licensure trials."
