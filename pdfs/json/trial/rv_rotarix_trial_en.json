Key strengths include exceptional sample sizes, standardized endpoint definitions (Vesikari scale), comprehensive mortality tracking, and transparent postmarketing surveillance that identified real-world intussusception risk. Limitations include minimal data on vulnerable populations (immunocompromised, chronic GI conditions studied populations explicitly excluded), partial autoimmune/neurological monitoring, and absent conflict of interest documentation. The trials meet or exceed regulatory standards for vaccine approval, with particularly strong safety surveillance infrastructure."
