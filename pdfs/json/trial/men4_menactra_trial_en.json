For children 9-12 months, control groups received childhood vaccines (MMRV, PCV7, HepA) without Menactra. The Td vaccine concomitant study used Td+placebo as comparator. No true saline placebo-controlled trials were conducted.",

For the Typhim Vi study: 'In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, 945 participants aged 18 through 55 years received Typhim Vi and Menactra concomitantly.' However, for the primary safety studies with Menomune: 'As the route of administration differed for the two vaccines (Menactra given intramuscularly, Menomune A/C/Y/W-135 given subcutaneously), study personnel collecting the safety data differed from personnel administering the vaccine.'",
      "level_description": "Some concomitant vaccine studies were double-blind, but the primary comparative studies against Menomune could not be fully blinded due to different routes of administration. Observer-blinding was used instead. The infant/toddler primary safety study was not described as double-blind."

However, the trials used active comparators (Menomune polysaccharide vaccine or concomitant childhood vaccines) rather than true placebo controls, limiting the ability to detect vaccine-attributable adverse events. Blinding was compromised in some studies due to different administration routes. The 6-month follow-up for SAEs is adequate, and a notable strength is the large post-marketing GBS safety study. Age-stratified data presentation is exemplary, but the absence of mortality data, conflict of interest disclosures, and detailed vulnerable subgroup analyses are notable gaps."
