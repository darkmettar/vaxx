    "summary": "Vaxneuvance was evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development program including multiple randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trials with over 5,000 pediatric and 7,400 adult participants. Key strengths include robust sample sizes, excellent age group stratification, dedicated studies in vulnerable populations (preterm, sickle cell, HIV, HSCT), standardized adverse event collection, and rigorous non-inferiority statistical analysis with transparent immunogenicity data. Notable limitations include the absence of placebo control (all trials used Prevnar 13 as active comparator), relatively short follow-up periods (mostly 6 months or less), no reported mortality data, absence of conflict of interest disclosures, and limited specific monitoring for autoimmune/neurological events. The active comparator design, while scientifically appropriate for an established vaccine class, limits ability to assess absolute vaccine-attributable adverse event rates."
