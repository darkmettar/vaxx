Each infant received two doses of either placebo or lyophilized PedvaxHIB. The placebo group had 22 cases of invasive Hib disease (8 after first dose, 14 after second dose) while the vaccine group had only 1 case (after the second dose). The protective efficacy was calculated to be 93% (95% CI: 57%-98%, p=0.001).",

The vaccine was also studied in genetically high-risk populations and poor vaccine responders. However, the package insert has limitations: short-term safety monitoring (48-72 hours), incomplete conflict of interest disclosure, absence of all-cause mortality data, and some data referenced only as 'on file' at the manufacturer. The post-marketing section identifies additional adverse events. Overall, the clinical evidence package is stronger than most pediatric vaccines due to the placebo-controlled efficacy trial, though documentation gaps remain."
