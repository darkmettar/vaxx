The pivotal Study 2 enrolled approximately 44,000 participants with robust randomization and stratification. Safety monitoring used standardized electronic diary collection with clearly defined severity grading. Vaccine efficacy of 95% against symptomatic COVID-19 was well-documented. However, limitations include relatively short placebo-controlled follow-up (median 2-6 months), absence of all-cause mortality reporting, limited inclusion of immunocompromised populations (only stable HIV included), incomplete autoimmune/neurological assessment, and no conflict of interest disclosures in this regulatory document. Post-marketing surveillance has identified myocarditis/pericarditis as notable safety signals, particularly in young males."
