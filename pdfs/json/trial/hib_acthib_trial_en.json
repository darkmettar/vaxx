No placebo control, blinding, or randomization details are described. Statistical analysis is basic with no inferential statistics. Some vulnerable populations were studied (Native Americans, sickle cell patients). Postmarketing surveillance is in place, but the document lacks transparency on full study protocols, conflict of interest disclosures, and all-cause mortality tracking."
