Post-marketing surveillance is comprehensive. However, limitations include: no pediatric trial data presented, relatively short follow-up periods (primarily 14 days for safety), limited statistical methodology details, no conflict of interest disclosures, and autoimmune/neurological events were only captured through post-marketing rather than prospective trial monitoring. The vaccine has been in use since 1983 with extensive real-world safety data, but the prescribing information focuses primarily on adult populations 50 years and older."
