Key strengths include large pediatric populations (>7,000 subjects), comprehensive age-group analyses, standardized grading scales with electronic capture, and the adult placebo-controlled efficacy trial (N=84,496). Limitations include: pediatric trials used active comparator rather than placebo, limited systematic assessment of autoimmune conditions, and absence of conflict of interest disclosures. The document provides extensive immunogenicity and safety data across multiple populations including high-risk groups."
