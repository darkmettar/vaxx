    "summary": "RECOMBIVAX HB (approved 1986) has limited clinical trial methodology documentation. Key deficiencies include: extremely short 5-day safety follow-up periods; reliance on historical controls rather than concurrent placebo groups for efficacy; absence of statistical methodology details; no all-cause mortality reporting; and missing conflict of interest disclosures. Strengths include good post-marketing surveillance infrastructure, appropriate separation by age groups, and some data on vulnerable populations. The neonatal efficacy study showed 95% protection against chronic HBV infection with 9-month follow-up. Sample sizes were modest (92-255 per age group for immunogenicity). This prescribing information reflects an older vaccine approved under less rigorous standards than would be expected today."
