The Italian efficacy trial showed 84% efficacy against WHO-defined pertussis. Key limitations include: use of active comparator (DT vaccine) rather than true placebo, short safety follow-up periods (4-28 days), absence of conflict of interest disclosures, no systematic tracking of autoimmune outcomes or all-cause mortality in trial data, and limited vulnerable subgroup analyses. Safety monitoring relied heavily on short-term solicited reactions with postmarketing surveillance for rare serious events."
