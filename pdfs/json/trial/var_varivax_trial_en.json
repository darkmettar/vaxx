However, significant limitations exist: the pivotal placebo-controlled trial used a prior formulation (not the currently marketed refrigerator-stable product), no placebo-controlled trials were conducted in adults, and the document lacks mortality data and conflict of interest disclosures. While the overall evidence base is adequate for demonstrating efficacy (94-98% against varicella), the trial design limitations regarding the current formulation and absence of key safety transparency metrics warrant consideration."
