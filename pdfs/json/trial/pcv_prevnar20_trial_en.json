Key limitations include: (1) reliance on active comparator (Prevnar 13) rather than placebo control, with effectiveness inferred through immunobridging; (2) 6-month SAE follow-up that may miss delayed adverse events; (3) absence of all-cause mortality data; (4) no conflict of interest disclosures; (5) immunocompromised population exclusion; and (6) some indications approved under accelerated approval pending confirmatory trials. Overall, the trial design is methodologically sound for demonstrating comparable safety and immunogenicity to established vaccines, but lacks direct placebo-controlled efficacy evidence specific to Prevnar 20."
