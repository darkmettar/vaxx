    "summary": "This FDA Summary Basis for Regulatory Action documents accelerated approval of BEXSERO based on surrogate immunogenicity endpoints (serum bactericidal antibody responses) rather than clinical efficacy endpoints. The clinical program included ~3,100 subjects in randomized trials plus ~15,000 in open-label expanded access. Key limitations include: only one of the main trials was placebo-controlled (others used active comparators), observer-blind rather than double-blind design, relatively short safety follow-up (30 days for SAEs in expanded access), absence of all-cause mortality data, and no conflict of interest disclosures. Post-marketing requirements mandate confirmatory effectiveness studies against broader strain panels. The immunogenicity data (63-94% composite response rates) support likely clinical benefit, but the accelerated approval pathway acknowledged that effectiveness against diverse circulating strains requires confirmation."
