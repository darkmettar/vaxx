The pivotal Sweden I Efficacy Trial was randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled with a large sample size (N=9,829) and 2-year follow-up demonstrating 84.9% efficacy against pertussis. US studies added substantial safety data across multiple doses and age groups. Standardized adverse event monitoring with diary cards and defined severity criteria was employed. Neurological events were specifically tracked. Weaknesses include use of DT rather than true inert placebo, limited published detail on inclusion/exclusion criteria, absence of conflict of interest disclosures, and limited specific data on vulnerable subgroups. Postmarketing surveillance is established through VAERS."
