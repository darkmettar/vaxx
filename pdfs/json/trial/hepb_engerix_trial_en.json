    "summary": "ENGERIX-B's clinical trial evidence as presented in the prescribing information has significant methodological limitations. While the vaccine was studied in multiple populations across 36 clinical studies with over 5,000 subjects, fundamental aspects of rigorous trial design are absent or undocumented: no placebo controls, no described blinding or randomization, and very short (4-day) safety follow-up. Strengths include separate age group analyses, standardized adverse event collection using symptom checklists, studies in vulnerable populations (hemodialysis, diabetics, premature infants), and comprehensive postmarketing surveillance. The neonatal efficacy study demonstrated 95% protection against chronic carrier state in high-risk infants, though based on only 58 subjects. The absence of placebo-controlled trials, lack of long-term safety monitoring, and missing mortality data represent notable gaps in the documented evidence base."
