Key limitations include lack of true placebo control (active comparators used throughout), inconsistent blinding across studies, and limited disclosure of conflicts of interest. Safety monitoring was standardized with 6-month follow-up for serious events. The postmarketing study identified a Bell's palsy signal. Neurological and autoimmune outcomes were not primary endpoints in pivotal trials. Overall, trial quality is adequate for regulatory approval but falls short of exemplary due to the absence of placebo controls and transparency gaps."
