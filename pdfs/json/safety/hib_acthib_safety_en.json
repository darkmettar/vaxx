    "pediatric_sample_size": {
      "rating": "adequate",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "explanation": "More than 7,000 infants and young children (<=2 years of age) received at least one dose of ActHIB during US clinical trials. Study P3T06 enrolled 1,454 children for the primary series, with 418 receiving the 4th dose. An additional trial evaluated 110 children aged 15-20 months. Sample sizes are reasonable for detecting common adverse events."
    },
    "follow_up_duration": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "Solicited adverse reactions were monitored within 0-3 days (Study P3T06) or up to 48 hours post-vaccination. Serious adverse events were tracked within 30 days following vaccination. This short follow-up period is inadequate for detecting delayed or long-term adverse effects."
    },
    "comparison_group": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "The document references comparative immunogenicity trials with other Hib conjugate vaccines (PedvaxHIB, HibTITER), but safety data primarily comes from single-arm studies or concomitant administration with other vaccines (DAPTACEL, IPOL, PCV7). No true placebo or saline control group is described for safety assessment."
    },
    "active_surveillance": {
      "rating": "adequate",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "explanation": "Studies used solicited adverse reaction monitoring with structured data collection at defined timepoints (6, 24, and 48 hours in one study; 0-3 days in Study P3T06). Local and systemic reactions were tracked using standardized categories and severity grading. This represents active surveillance methodology."
    },
    "neurological_monitoring": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "The document mentions Guillain-Barre Syndrome as a warning/precaution related to tetanus toxoid component, and convulsions are listed in postmarketing reports. One SAE of seizure with apnea was reported as possibly related. However, no systematic neurological monitoring or formal neurodevelopmental assessments are described in the clinical trials."
    },
    "vulnerable_subgroups": {
      "rating": "partial",
      "emoji": "⚠️",
      "explanation": "The document mentions immunogenicity data in children with sickle cell anemia and Alaskan Native Americans (who have higher disease susceptibility and lower vaccine responses). Section 5.3 addresses altered immunocompetence. However, detailed safety data in these vulnerable subgroups is not provided."
    },
    "data_transparency": {
      "rating": "adequate",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "explanation": "The prescribing information includes detailed tables of adverse reaction rates by timepoint and severity (Tables 1 and 2), SAE rates (50/1,455 or 3.4% after doses 1-3), and specific percentages for common reactions. References to published studies are provided. However, individual-level data or confidence intervals are not included."
    },
    "post_marketing_surveillance": {
      "rating": "adequate",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "explanation": "Section 6.2 describes postmarketing experience including spontaneous reports of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, angioedema), convulsions, extensive limb swelling, peripheral edema, pruritus, and rash. VAERS reporting is encouraged. The limitations of passive surveillance (uncertain population size, inability to establish causality) are appropriately acknowledged."
    }
  },
  "overall": {
    "rating": "adequate",
    "emoji": "✅",
    "summary": "ActHIB vaccine has adequate safety documentation with clinical trials involving over 7,000 pediatric subjects and structured adverse event monitoring. Key strengths include active surveillance methodology, transparent reporting of reaction rates, and established postmarketing surveillance. Key limitations include short follow-up periods (48 hours to 30 days), lack of true placebo controls, limited systematic neurological monitoring, and insufficient safety data specifically in vulnerable subgroups. The 3.4% SAE rate within 30 days (with one possibly vaccine-related seizure with apnea) warrants attention."
