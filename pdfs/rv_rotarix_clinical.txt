Executive Summary

This Biologics License Application (BLA) contains efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety data
provided by GlaxoSmithKline to support approval of RotarixTM, a live, oral, monovalent rotavirus
(RV) vaccine indicated for the prevention of RV gastroenteritis (GE) caused by G1 and non-G1
types. RotarixTM is to be administered as a 2-dose series to healthy infants 6 to 24 weeks of age,
with doses separated by a minimum interval of 4 weeks. The proposed release specification
potency is ------- median Cell Culture Infective Dose (CCID50) per dose of live, attenuated human
RV, with an end-of-shelf-life potency of ≥ 106.0 CCID50 per dose.
The Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) contains six Phase II trials and five Phase III trials. Two
of the Phase III trials are considered pivotal efficacy studies: Rota-023, conducted in 11 Latin
American countries, and Rota-036, conducted in six European countries. Rota-023 was also
specifically designed and powered to evaluate the risk of definite intussusception (IS), with over
63,000 infants from 11 Latin American countries plus Finland receiving either RotarixTM or placebo.
Rota-033 was a Phase III lot-to-lot consistency study of 3 lots conducted in three Latin American
countries. Rota-060, a Phase III trial evaluating the immunogenicity of routine childhood vaccines
when co-administered with RotarixTM, was conducted in the U.S.
Efficacy
Two Phase III studies, Rota-023 and Rota-036, are considered pivotal to the efficacy claims in this
BLA. The primary objective of Rota-036 was to assess vaccine efficacy (VE) against any RV GE
during the first efficacy follow-up period from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until the end of the first RV
epidemic season. The primary objective of Rota-023 was to assess VE against severe RV GE
during the first efficacy follow-up period from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 12 months of age. Both
studies were prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials. In each study, the
According to Protocol (ATP) efficacy cohort was used for the primary efficacy analyses, and
consisted of 17,867 subjects (RotarixTM: 9009, placebo: 8858) in Rota-023 and 3874 subjects
(RotarixTM: 2572, placebo: 1302) in Rota-036. VE for each endpoint was calculated using the
following formula: 1 – (attack rate in the RotarixTM group ÷ attack rate in the placebo group).
In Rota-036, RV GE was defined as an episode of GE in which RV other than the vaccine strain
was identified in a stool sample collected no later than 7 days after GE symptom onset, while
severe RV GE was defined as an episode of RV GE with a score of ≥ 11 points using the Vesikari
scale. In Rota-023, the primary case definition of severe RV GE was defined as an episode of RV
GE requiring hospitalization and/or rehydration therapy (equivalent to WHO plan B or C) in a
medical facility.
The applicant demonstrated that RotarixTM, at 106.5 CCID50 per dose, was effective in preventing
naturally occurring RV GE of any grade of severity and severe RV GE during the first year of life.
VE was 87.1% (95% CI: 79.6, 92.1%) against any RV GE in Rota-036. VE against severe RV GE

4

was 95.8% (95% CI: 89.6, 98.7%) in Rota-036 compared to 84.7% (95% CI: 71.7, 92.4%) in Rota023, suggesting geographical and/or ethnic differences in efficacy. Protection was also
demonstrated against any and severe RV GE caused by circulating G1 and certain non-G1 types,
as well as other clinical endpoints during the first-year, second-year, and combined (first- and
second-year) efficacy follow-up periods.
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity to RotarixTM was assessed by measuring serum anti-RV IgA antibodies, considered
a standard measure of immunity in most field studies and vaccine trials, at pre- and postvaccination time points. Definitions of seropositivity and seroconversion were uniform across
studies. Seropositivity was defined as an anti-RV IgA concentration ≥ 20 U/mL. Seroconversion was
defined as an anti-RV IgA concentration ≥ 20 U/mL in a subject seronegative for RV pre-Dose 1.
Stool samples were also collected to evaluate vaccine take, defined as anti-RV IgA seropositivity in
any post-vaccination blood sample or detection of RV antigen in any post-vaccination stool sample
in a RV-uninfected subject pre-vaccination. Anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates and geometric mean
concentrations (GMCs) were measured in all or a pre-defined subset of subjects from all BLA
studies, while vaccine take was estimated in 7 studies, including Rota-033. In each study, the ATP
immunogenicity cohort was used for the primary immunogenicity analyses.
In studies that evaluated RotarixTM at 106.5 CCID50 to 106.8 CCID50 per dose (total number of
RotarixTM subjects at these potencies in the ATP immunogenicity cohorts = 2642), 2 doses of
RotarixTM appeared immunogenic in infants, as demonstrated by post-Dose 2 anti-RV IgA
seroconversion rates, GMCs, and vaccine take rates. At 1-2 months post-Dose 2, the anti-RV IgA
seroconversion rate was 86.5% (95% CI: 83.9, 88.8%) in Rota-036 compared to 76.8% (95% CI:
72.4, 80.9%) in Rota-023. Similarly, 1-2 month post-Dose 2 GMC was higher in Rota-036 (197.2
U/mL; 95% CI: 175.2, 222.0 U/mL) than in Rota-023 (102.6 U/mL; 95% CI: 86.3, 122.0 U/mL).
These results suggest that geographical and/or ethnic factors may impact the anti-RV IgA immune
response to RotarixTM.
Safety
Intussusception (IS)
In Rota-023, the primary safety objective was to determine the safety of RotarixTM with respect to IS
occurring within 31 days (Days 0-30) after each dose. The safety database consisted of the Total
Vaccinated Cohort (RotarixTM: 31,673, placebo: 31,552) that was followed from Dose 1 to 1-2 months
post-Dose 2. Definite IS was defined as a diagnosis of IS confirmed by intestinal invagination at
surgery or autopsy, or by radiologic techniques (gas/liquid contrast enema or abdominal ultrasound).
The primary safety objective was achieved if the following two criteria were met: upper limit of the 95%
confidence interval (CI) of the risk difference (RotarixTM minus placebo) for definite IS was <6/10,000
and lower limit of the 95% CI of the risk difference was < 0. An increased risk of definite IS following
RotarixTM vaccination was not observed within 31 days after any dose when the date of IS diagnosis
was used to categorize cases (risk difference/10,000 = -0.32; 95% CI: -2.91, 2.18/10,000). An
increased risk within 31 days was also not demonstrated in an FDA analysis that used the date of IS
onset to categorize cases (risk difference = -8.48/107; 95% CI: -2.63, 2.61/10,000). Increased risk was
not observed after Dose 1 or Dose 2. Temporal clustering after either dose was also not observed.
When pooled safety data from 8 BLA studies of subjects who received RotarixTM at the proposed
licensure potency (≥ 106.0 CCID50 per dose; n = 36,755) were analyzed (Core Integrated Safety
Summary [ISS] analysis), a statistically significant increased risk of IS within 31 days after RotarixTM
was not observed (RotarixTM: 9 [0.024%], placebo: 7 [0.020%]; RR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.41, 3.90). Pooled
safety data from 5 BLA studies of subjects who received RotarixTM at the less-than licensure potency (<

5

106.0 CCID50 per dose; n = 3076) (Supplementary ISS analysis) also did not demonstrate a significantly
increased risk of IS within 31 days after RotarixTM (RotarixTM: 1 [0.033%], placebo: 0 [0%]; LL 95% CI:
0.01).
Serious adverse events - deaths
A total of 118 deaths (0.158% of all study subjects) were reported throughout the course of the
studies. Overall death rates were 0.184% (68/36,755) in the RotarixTM (≥ 106.0 CCID50 potency)
group, 0.163% (5/3076) in the RotarixTM (< 106.0 CCID50 potency) group, and 0.158% (55/34,739) in
the placebo group. In the Core and Supplementary ISS analyses for deaths, there were no
significant imbalances between treatment groups in the rates of fatalities during the 31 days postvaccination or entire study follow-up periods. For either follow-up period, there were no significant
imbalances in fatalities between groups for any Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) Preferred Term (PT).
Pneumonia deaths – Rota-023
In Rota-023, an FDA analysis revealed statistically significant difference between treatment groups
in the rate of subjects with pneumonia-related deaths between Dose 1 and Visit 3 (1-2 months postDose 2 or 2-4 months post-Dose 1) (RotarixTM: 0.051%, placebo: 0.019%; p = 0.0354). The
applicant provided a p-value of 0.054. Pneumonia-related death rates within 31 days postvaccination were still higher in RotarixTM compared to placebo recipients (0.022% [7/31,673] vs.
0.010% [3/31,552]). However, there were no differences between the treatment groups in rates of
non-fatal pneumonia events and pneumonia hospitalizations (Dose 1 to Visit 3, within 31 days and
beyond 31 days post-vaccination).
Serious adverse events
In the Core and Supplementary ISS analyses for severe adverse events (SAEs), there were no
significant imbalances between treatment groups in the rates of subjects with at least 1 SAE during
the 31 days post-vaccination or during the entire study follow-up period. In the Core ISS analysis, PTs
Diarrhea, Gastroenteritis, Dehydration, and Ileus were reported significantly less during the entire
study follow-up periods in the RotarixTM group than in the placebo group. There were no significant
imbalances for any other specific PT except Foreign body trauma (RotarixTM: 11/36,755 [0.035%],
placebo: 1/34,739 [0.003%]; RR = 9.11, 95% CI: 1.31, 394.8). However, all cases involved swallowing
a foreign body between 48-483 days post-dose, and were assessed by the applicant as not related to
vaccination.
Convulsions – Rota-023
In Rota-023, a statistically significant difference between treatment groups was observed in the rate
of PT Convulsions between Dose 1 and Visit 3 (RotarixTM: 16/31,673 [0.051%], placebo: 6/31,552
[0.019%]; p = 0.034). However, when convulsion-related PTs (Convulsions, Epilepsy, Grand mal
convulsion, Status epilepticus, and Tonic convulsion) were pooled in a post-hoc analysis, a
statistically significant difference between groups was not demonstrated (RotarixTM: 20/31,673
[0.063%], placebo: 12/31,552 [0.038%]; p = 0.219). Furthermore, convulsion-related episodes within
31 days after any dose occurred less in RotarixTM recipients than placebo recipients. Among
subjects who experienced a convulsion-related event within 31 days after any dose, 7 (0.022%)
were RotarixTM and 9 (0.029%) were placebo recipients. Within 43 days post-vaccination, 12
(0.04%) RotarixTM and 9 (0.03%) placebo recipients reported a convulsion-related event.
Imbalances between groups in convulsion-related PTs within 31 or 43 days post-vaccination were not
observed in Rota-036.

6

Pneumonia – Rota-036
In Rota-036, rates of PT Pneumonia were significantly higher in the RotarixTM compared to the
placebo group from Dose 1 to Visit 7 (end of the second RV epidemic season) (24 vs. 4, p = 0.029).
Of the 28 cases, only one (RotarixTM group) was reported within 31 days after vaccination. CBER’s
analysis showed that 3 cases in the RotarixTM group compared to 0 in the placebo group reported
PT Pneumonia within 43 days after vaccination. Furthermore, when the CBER reviewer combined
the pneumonia-related PTs (Pneumonia, Bronchopneumonia, Lobar pneumonia, Pneumonia viral),
an imbalance was still seen from Dose 1 to Visit 7 (RotarixTM: 31, placebo: 7), within 31 days postvaccination (RotarixTM: 2, placebo: 0) and within 43 days post-vaccination (RotarixTM: 5, placebo: 0).
Imbalances between groups in pneumonia-related PTs within 31 or 43 days post-vaccination were not
observed in Rota-023.
Unsolicited adverse events (non-SAEs)
In the Core and Supplementary ISS analyses for unsolicited AEs 31 days post-vaccination, there
were no significant imbalances between groups in the rates of subjects with at least 1 AE of any
intensity or Grade 3 intensity after any dose. In the Core ISS analysis, there were small but
statistically significant increases in RotarixTM compared to placebo recipients in rates of PTs
Irritability (11.4% vs. 8.7%) and Flatulence (2.2% vs. 1.3%). However, no significant imbalances in
Grade 3 Irritability and Flatulence were observed. In the Supplementary ISS analysis, there was a
statistically significant increase in rates of PT Bronchitis in RotarixTM compared to placebo recipients
(1.85% vs. 0.74%, RR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.27, 4.90%). Grade 3 Bronchitis occurred in 6 RotarixTM
compared to 0 placebo recipients. The applicant stated that this imbalance was driven by an
imbalance of Bronchitis in Rota-006. FDA calculated a total of 44 (3.9%) RotarixTM recipients (<
106.0 CCID50 groups) compared to 10 (1.8%) placebo recipients in Rota-006 who reported PT
Bronchitis during Days 0 to 30 post-vaccination. Grade 3 Bronchitis occurred in 1 RotarixTM
compared to 0 placebo recipients. In Rota-006, the rate of any Bronchitis in the RotarixTM group
receiving the licensure potency was higher than in the placebo group during this same interval
(3.7% vs. 1.8%); no Grade 3 Bronchitis was reported in this RotarixTM group. In the Core ISS
analysis, when PTs Bronchitis and Bronchitis acute were combined, 116 (2.3%) RotarixTM recipients
compared to 45 (1.6%) placebo subjects reported an AE. Grade 3 AE rates were comparable
(RotarixTM: 0.16%, placebo: 0.14%).
Solicited adverse events
In the Core and Supplementary ISS analyses for solicited symptoms 8 days (Days 0-7) postvaccination, there were no significant imbalances in rates of fever, irritability, loss of appetite,
vomiting, or diarrhea, of any severity or Grade 3 severity, between the RotarixTM and placebo groups
after any dose. The exception was Grade 3 cough/runny nose after any dose in the Core ISS analysis
(RotarixTM: 3.6%, placebo: 3.2%, RR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.99). However, imbalances in rates of
cough/runny nose after each dose were not observed.
Shedding and Transmission
Post-vaccination RV antigen shedding in stools was evaluated in all or a subset of subjects from 7
BLA studies. In all studies (total number of RotarixTM subjects in the ATP immunogenicity cohorts =
1086), samples were collected on Day 7 after each dose, while in 4 studies, samples were also
collected on Day 15 post-dose. In addition, 4 studies collected samples at 30 days post-Dose 1
(pre-Dose 2), while 4 studies collected samples at 60 days post-Dose 1 (pre-Dose 2).
Among RotarixTM treatment groups from studies that administered vaccine at 106.5 CCID50 to 106.8
CCID50 per dose, post-Dose 1 RV antigen shedding ranged from 50.0% to 80.0% of subjects at Day
7, 19.2% to 64.1% at Day 15, 0% to 24.3% at Day 30, and 0% to 2.6% at Day 60. The highest rates

7

of post-Dose 1 shedding at Days 7, 15, and 30 occurred in subjects from Rota-007, a Phase II
study conducted in Singapore. The applicant stated that these results may be due to a population
effect or older age at Dose 1 (median = 13 weeks) when maternal antibodies known to have an
impact on RV immune response have already declined. Among the same RotarixTM treatment
groups, post-Dose 2 shedding ranged from 4.2% to 18.4% at Day 7, 0% to 16.2% at Day 15, and
0% to 1.2% at Day 30. Shedding at Day 45 post-Dose 2, monitored only in Rota-033, was 0%.
Highest post-Dose 2 shedding rates at Days 7 and 15 were also in subjects from Rota-007.
In 2 BLA studies that administered RotarixTM at 106.5 CCID50 per dose, an estimated 25.6% to
26.5% of subjects shed live RV at Day 7 post-Dose 1. In addition, data from 4 other studies
combined demonstrated that among RV antigen-positive samples, live RV was detected in fewer
samples from RotarixTM vaccinated subjects than samples from wild-type RV GE episodes (14.6%
vs. 68.6%)
Transmission of RotarixTM was not formally evaluated in any of the BLA studies.
Co-Administration with Other Childhood Vaccines
Concomitant administration of other routine childhood vaccines with RotarixTM or placebo was
allowed in 10 of the 12 BLA studies. Only one study (Rota-014, Phase II, South Africa; n = 447)
allowed concomitant administration of oral poliovirus vaccine.
Only Rota-060 was specifically designed to evaluate non-inferiority of immune responses to
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus, Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), or S.
pneumoniae antigens when these routine vaccines were co-administered with RotarixTM. All study
subjects received 3 doses each of Pediarix® (DTaP-HepB-IPV), Prevnar® (pneumococcal 7-valent
conjugate vaccine), and ActHIB®. In the co-administration group, RotarixTM was administered with
the first two routine vaccine doses, while in the separate administration group, RotarixTM was
administered one month after routine vaccine Doses 1 and 2. Antibody responses to diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis (PRN, FHA, PT), hepatitis B (HBs), poliovirus (types 1, 2, 3), Hib (PRP), and S.
pneumoniae (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) antigens were measured one month after Dose
3 of routine vaccinations. Non-inferiority criteria were based on comparisons of seroprotection rates
(diphtheria, tetanus, hep B, Hib, polio) and GMCs (pertussis, S. pneumoniae) between treatment
groups. Non-inferiority criteria were met for all antigens, indicating that co-administration of RotarixTM
with routine childhood vaccines did not impair the immune responses to any of these vaccine
antigens.
Conclusion
RotarixTM at a potency of 106.5 CCID50 per dose was effective in preventing RV GE of any grade of
severity and in preventing severe RV GE caused by naturally-occurring RV strains during the first year
of life across heterogeneous geographical populations. Protection against any and severe RV GE was
also demonstrated against circulating G1 and certain non-G1 types that are similar in distribution in the
U.S. Co-administration of RotarixTM with other routine vaccines in the U.S. did not cause interference of
the immune response to each of these vaccine antigens. RotarixTM had no increased risk of
intussusception. However, increases in pneumonia-related deaths and convulsion-related SAEs were
observed in RotarixTM compared to placebo recipients from Dose 1 to Visit 3 in Rota-023, although the
difference in pneumonia-related deaths occurring within 31 days post-vaccination was smaller. Rates of
bronchitis within 31 days post-vaccination were also generally higher in RotarixTM recipients, most
notably in Rota-006.

8

Recommendation:
The reviewer recommends that Rotarix be approved for use in infants 6 to 24 weeks of age.
As part of the pre-BLA agreement, the applicant will conduct a prospective US post-licensure
observational safety study that will be adequately powered to evaluate the risk of intussusception.
Other measured outcomes will include deaths from all causes, hospitalizations due to acute lower
respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia), convulsions, and Kawasaki disease.

Significant Findings from Other Review Disciplines

4.1

Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC)

Description of the Product
GSK Biological’s candidate oral live attenuated human RV (HRV) vaccine, Rotarix®, was developed
from the 89-12 candidate vaccine strain, a G1P[8] strain isolated from a naturally infected 15-month
study subject (subject #----, 1988-89 RV season, Cincinnati, OH) and attenuated by 33 passages in
African Green Monkey cell culture.48, 49, 50 The 89-12 vaccine, licensed by Avant Immunotherapeutics
(US), was subsequently sub-licensed by GSK Biologicals in 1997, after which time several process
changes were implemented to obtain a cloned 89-12 strain at passage --, referred to as the
RIX4414 vaccine strain and subsequently used as GSK Biological’s candidate HRV vaccine.
GSK Biological’s candidate HRV vaccine used for clinical testing was prepared by reconstituting the
lyophilized preparation with separately supplied liquid calcium carbonate based buffer prior to oral
administration in subjects. The composition of 1 mL of Rotarix is shown below in Table 3.

The CMC reviewer did not identify any major manufacturing issues and control problems. Two
comments raised by the reviewer related to the applicant’s choice of ≥ 106.0 CCID50 as the end of
shelf-life potency and ----- CCID50 as the proposed specification potency. The applicant stated that
clinical lots from a Phase II trial (Rota-006) containing 105.6 CCID50and 106.6 CCID50 were chosen to
select the final dose potency. The CMC reviewer questioned these lots, rather than the Phase III
lots, were not chosen. The reviewer also raised the question as to why the applicant --------------------

9

------------------------------------ rotavirus titer allowable per vaccine dose. At the time of this review,
these potency-related issues were still being discussed and further investigated by the review team.
The bioassay reviewer did not identify statistical bioassay related issues that may preclude the BLA
submission from being approved by the agency.
Please refer to CBER’s CMC and bioassay reviews for more details.
4.2

Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology

One single dose combination repeat dose toxicity study was submitted in support of the BLA. In this
study, 21-day old ------------ rats were given 4 doses of rotavirus vaccine orally. The four doses
used exceeded the number of injections intended for use in the clinic, with dosing intervals of 2
weeks. The full human dose of 0.5 ml of vaccine was used in the study. Four groups of rats were
studied: saline group, CaCO3 group, human rotavirus strain RIX 4414 at 106.7 ffu and CaCO3 group,
and RIX 4414 at 106.1 ffu.
No treatment-related effects were observed on the following endpoints: clinical signs, mortality,
body weight, food intake, ophthalmology, body temperature, coagulation, macroscopic findings
upon necropsy, histopathology and clinical chemistry. Of note, no histopathological changes were
found in the intestinal villi such as epithelial syncytia and no intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions
in the ileum.
Low seroconversion rates of 10% and 20% were observed in the study population. Variable viral
shedding was observed in rats given the rotavirus strain.
Please refer to CBER’s toxicology review for more details.

Disease or Health-Related Condition(s) Studied and Available Interventions

Epidemiology
Rotavirus (RV) infection is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis (GE) in infants and
young children worldwide. In the United States, RV infection causes 2.7 million GE episodes, over
400,000 outpatient visits, and up to 70,000 hospitalizations and 60 deaths annually in children
under 5 years of age.1, 2
RV is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route through close person-to-person contact and
through fomites.3 Respiratory droplets may be another mode of transmission.4
RV disease occurs from winter to spring in temperate climates, and year-round in tropical and
subtropical areas.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 In the US, disease occurs from November to March.10, 11, 12 In North
America and Europe, most RV infections occur in the first and second years of life, while severe GE
occurs mainly in 3 to 35 month-old children.1, 13, 14 Subsequent infections usually result in much
milder disease. 13
Virology/Molecular Epidemiology
RV is classified according to a binary system based on two protein types: G (glycoprotein) types
and P (protease-cleaved protein) types. Ten G types and 11 P types have been isolated from
humans. These human RVs can further be classified into two major genetically distinct groups: Wa

10

genogroup and DS-1 genogroup. The Wa genogroup includes most human G1, G3, G4, and G9
strains, while the DS-1 genogroup is comprised mainly of G2 strains.
Worldwide, 88.5% of childhood RV diarrhea is caused by G types 1 to 4 associated with P types
P[8] and P[4].15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 In the 1990’s, G9 type appeared to emerge as the fifth most common
type, with mostly G9P[8] strains circulating in the US and Europe.21,22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 In North
America, Europe and Australia, G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8] represent over 90% of RV
infections.20 In the US, the yearly prevalence of G1, G2, G3, and G4 types have been 70%, 6-15%,
1-8%, and 0-2%.20, 21, 24, 30These figures are similar to those of other developed countries.20 Other
uncommon types such as G1P[4] and G2P[8] also circulate in these countries.20, 22, 23, 26, 31
As shown in Table 4 below, distribution of prevalent RV types are comparable between North America,
Latin America, and Europe, areas where the HRV vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated.

Immunity
RV infection in children induces serum and intestinal antibody responses that result in protection
against diarrhea, especially severe diarrhea, upon subsequent infection. Serum antibodies consist
of specific IgM, followed by anti-RV IgA and IgG. Small intestinal antibodies are predominantly IgA.
Specific serum IgA antibodies are generally considered the standard measure of immunity in most
field studies and vaccine trials.
While the humoral immune response is considered the key mechanism of protection, human and
animal studies have also demonstrated that cell-mediated immunity may play a more prominent role in
the RV immune response.32, 33, 34 However, mice studies indicate that although RV-specific cytolytic T
cells help to resolve infection, they are less protective against reinfection than antibody.35
The G (VP7) and P (VP4) proteins are the two main targets of neutralizing antibodies.36 However, it is
likely that a protective immune response involves all structural and non-structural proteins of RV.
In children 0 to 24 months old, RV infections during the first life protect against severe RV
reinfection during the second year of life, even when the second infection is caused by a different G
type from the first.37 In most cases, homotypic immunity (immunity against the same RV type)
develops after the first infection, with heterotypic immunity (immunity against different RV types)
developing with successive RV infections.37 Even asymptomatic infection during the first year of life
induces the same level of protection as symptomatic infection, thereby allowing reasonable
assumption that vaccines that cause asymptomatic RV infection may provide adequate protection.

37, 38, 39, 40

Clinical disease
After a 2 to 4 day incubation period, abrupt onset of fever, abdominal distress, diarrhea and
vomiting occur. Diarrheal stools are typically loose and water and occur frequently; mucus is found
less often, with blood being rare. Symptoms usually last 3 to 9 days, and can lead to severe
dehydration. Untreated severe RV GE in infants can be rapidly fatal. Viral shedding can be
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR), and can persist for as long as 57 days after disease onset in
immunocompetent hosts.41, 42

11

Treatment of RV GE is supportive and focuses on preventing dehydration or restoring fluid and
electrolyte balance, such as with oral rehydration solutions and/or IV fluid treatment. Anti-diarrheal
agents are not recommended.
Current preventive measures have had only limited impact on global RV disease burden. Therefore,
vaccination against RV represents an important strategy to control disease morbidity and mortality.
5.2

Important Information from Pharmacologically Related Products, Including Marketed Products

Development of RV vaccines began with monovalent bovine RV vaccine candidates, including
RIT4237 and WC3, which demonstrated variable efficacy leading to discontinuation of
development.43, 44
The first U.S. licensed RV vaccine was RotaShield®, a tetravalent (G1-4) rhesus-human
reassortant vaccine given in a 3-dose schedule.45 However, this vaccine was withdrawn from the US
market due to the development of an unexpected association with intussusception (IS).46
In 2006, RotaTeq®, a live oral pentavalent recombinant human-bovine RV vaccine given in a 3dose schedule, was licensed in the US, and has shown no safety concerns.47
5.3

Previous Human Experience with the Product Including Foreign Experience

Rotarix at a potency of at least 106.0 CCID50 was initially licensed in Mexico on July 12, 2004, and
has been subsequently licensed in 99 other countries worldwide. Safety information from postmarketing surveillance and unblinded SAEs from ongoing clinical trials during the period from July
2006 to January 2007 and January 2007 to July 2007 were submitted in the BLA (Periodic Safety
Update Report; m5.3.6). Please refer to section 10.4.13 for further review of post-marketing safety.
------- studies, in which a total of ----- subjects (------ infants) received -------------------Rotarix or placebo, were not submitted as part of the BLA because of their limited relevance to use
of Rotarix in US infants, as indicated below in Table 5.

Regulatory Background Information (FDA- applicant Meetings, Advisory Committee
Meetings, Commitments)

During a CBER-GSK teleconference on May 5, 2006, CBER requested that GSK further investigate
the greater number of subjects that withdrew consent, not due to an AE, from Lot A compared to
other study groups in Rota-033. Also during this teleconference, CBER requested further
investigation of the lower GMC observed with lot B in Rota-033.

12

A pre-BLA meeting between Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and GSK
representatives was held on July 17, 2006 to discuss the general structure, format, and content of
the US BLA for licensure of Rotarix. The final list of 10 studies to be submitted in the BLA was
agreed to by both parties during a telephone conference call on July 31, 2006.
Subsequently, during a pre-BLA meeting follow-up telephone conversation between CBER and
GSK on September 22, 2006, it was agreed that immunogenicity results of Rota-060 would be
submitted during the BLA review, within 60 days of the BLA submission, followed by submission of
the 6-month follow-up safety report in September 2007.
The statistical analysis plan for the integrated safety summary involving the 10 studies submitted in
the BLA was agreed upon by CBER and GSK on December 5, 2006, during a planned
teleconference.

Summary of Individual BLA studies
All studies were conducted in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled manner involving
healthy infants.
Rota-004 (Finland): The primary objective was to determine if 2 doses of Rotarix could prevent RV
GE over one RV season post-vaccination. Secondary objectives were to assess VE against severe
RV GE during the 1st and 2nd season, VE against any RV GE during the 2nd season, combined VE
over 2 seasons, and the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of Rotarix. Subjects 6-12 weeks
of age received either two doses of 105.3 CCID50 of Rotarix or placebo on a 0, 2-month schedule.
Co-administration of routine vaccinations and feeding 1 hour pre-vaccination were prohibited.
Rota-005 (US, Canada): The primary objective was to assess the reactogenicity and
immunogenicity of 2 doses of Rotarix at different potencies. Secondary objectives were to assess
safety of Rotarix, explore the effect of unrestricted feeding (breast vs formula, 60 minutes pre- vs 30
minutes post-vaccination) on immunogenicity, determine the rate of RV GE, and to evaluate
immunogenicity of co-administered routine vaccinations. Subjects 6-12 weeks of age received 2
doses of Rotarix (105.6 CCID50 or 106.6 CCID50) or placebo on a 0, 2-month schedule. DTaP, Hib,
IPV, and 7-valent S. pneumoniae vaccines were co-administered. Pre-dose feeding was allowed.
Rota-006 (Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela): The primary objective was to determine if 2 doses of
Rotarix at different potencies could prevent RV GE during the 1st efficacy follow-up period.
Secondary objectives were to assess VE against severe RV GE during the 1st follow-up period, VE
against RV types during the 1st follow-up period, VE against any and severe RV GE during the 2nd
follow-up period, to assess immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of Rotarix, and to explore the
immunogenicity of co-administered routine vaccinations, and the effect of unrestricted feeding
(breast vs formula, 60 minutes pre- vs 30 minutes post-vaccination) on the immune response to
Rotarix. Subjects 6-12 weeks of age received 2 doses of Rotarix 105.3 CCID50, Rotarix 105.6 CCID50,
Rotarix 106.6 CCID50 or placebo on a 0, 2-month schedule. In addition, a subset of 121 subjects
received a 3rd dose of vaccine or placebo. All subjects were followed during the 1st efficacy period
for 12 months, with a subset of subjects followed for an additional 6 to 12 months. DTwP-HepB and
Hib were co-administered, while OPV was administered 2 weeks apart from study vaccines. Prevaccination feeding was allowed.

19

Rota-007 (Singapore): The primary objective was to determine if 2 doses of Rotarix could prevent
RV GE during the 1st efficacy follow-up period. Secondary objectives were to assess safety,
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Rotarix at 3 potencies, and to explore the immunogenicity of
co-administered routine vaccinations and effect of unrestricted feeding (breast vs formula, 60
minutes pre- vs 30 minutes post-vaccination) on the immune response to Rotarix. Subjects 11-17
weeks of age received 2 doses of Rotarix 105.3 CCID50, Rotarix 105.6 CCID50, Rotarix 106.6 CCID50 or
placebo on a 0, 1-month schedule. All subjects were followed until approximately 18 months of age.
DTaP, IPV and Hib were co-administered. Pre-vaccination feeding was allowed.
Rota-014 (South Africa): The primary objective was to demonstrate that co-administration of
Rotarix did not decrease poliovirus immune response 1 month after the 3rd dose of OPV. Secondary
objects were to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Rotarix when coadministered with OPV or IPV. The study was conducted in 2 parts. Subjects 5-10 weeks of age
(Part 1) or 8-17 weeks of age (Part 2) received one of the following regimens on a 0, 1-month
schedule: Rotarix 105.6 CCID50 + OPV + DTaP/Hib, Rotarix 105.6 CCID50 + DTaP-IPV/Hib, or
placebo + OPV + DTaP/Hib. Subjects were followed until 18 months of age. Co-administration of
routine vaccines according to local recommendations and unrestricted feeding were allowed.
Rota-023 (Latin America – Efficacy study; Latin America + Finland – Safety Study): The
primary objectives were to 1) to determine the safety of Rotarix with respect to the risk of
intussusception (IS) within 31 days post-vaccination after each dose and 2) determine if Rotarix can
prevent severe RV GE up to 12 months of age. The primary clinical case definition for severe GE
was an episode that required hospitalization and/or rehydration therapy (equivalent to WHO plan B
or C) in a medical facility. Secondary objectives were to VE against different RV types, VE in the
second year of life, vaccine immunogenicity in a subset of subjects, and vaccine safety throughout
the study period. Subjects 6-12 weeks of age (6-13 weeks in Chile) received 2 doses of Rotarix
106.5 CCID50 or placebo on a 0, 1-month or 0, 2-month schedule. All 63,225 enrolled subjects were
followed up to 30-90 days after Dose 2 (safety study). A subset of 20,169 subjects was followed
until 12 months of age (efficacy study). A subset of 15,183 subjects was followed until 24 months of
age (efficacy study). Co-administration of routine vaccines and unrestricted feeding were allowed.
Rota-033 (Columbia, Mexico, Peru): The primary objective was to demonstrate lot-to-lot
consistency of Rotarix by assessing immunogenicity 2 months post-Dose 2. Secondary objectives
were to assess the lot-to-lot consistency of Rotarix in terms of reactogenicity and to assess the
safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine compared to placebo. Subjects 6-12
weeks of age received 2 doses of Rotarix 106.5 CCID50 from one of 3 consecutive production lots (A,
B, or C) or placebo on a 0, 2-month schedule. DTwP, HepB and Hib were co-administered, while
OPV was administered 2 weeks apart from study vaccines. Unrestricted feeding was allowed.
Rota-036 (Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain): The primary objective was
to determine if Rotarix can prevent RV GE of any severity up until the end of the 1st RV season.
Secondary objectives were to assess VE against severe RV GE, RV GE requiring any medical
attention, RV GE causing hospitalization, and any and severe RV GE caused by different types
during the 1st efficacy follow-up period, as well as VE in the 2nd efficacy and combined follow-up
periods. Other secondary objectives were to assess vaccine safety in all subjects, reactogenicity
and immunogenicity of Rotarix, the effect of unrestricted feeding (breast for ≥ one dose vs at none
of the doses) on the immune response to Rotarix, and immunogenicity of co-administered routine
vaccinations. Subjects 6-14 weeks of age received 2 doses of Rotarix 106.5 CCID50 or placebo on a
0, 1-month or 0, 2-month schedule. Co-administration of routine vaccines was allowed.
Rota-039 (Thailand): The primary objective was to compare the immunogenicity between Rotarix
reconstituted without buffer (with or without feeding) and Rotarix reconstituted with buffer (with or
without feeding), measured by vaccine take at 2 months post-Dose 2. Other objectives were to
assess the immunogenicity of Rotarix when stored at 37°C for 7 days instead of the recommended
temperature of 2° to 8°C, and to assess vaccine reactogenicity and safety under the different
reconstitution and storage conditions. In addition, an exploratory assessment of the effect of feeding
on the immunogenicity of Rotarix reconstituted without buffer was performed, as feeding
immediately before vaccine administration was expected to have a buffering effect. Subjects 6-12
weeks of age received one of the following regimens on a 0, 2-month schedule: Rotarix 106.5 CCID50
reconstituted with buffer, Rotarix 106.5 CCID50 reconstituted without buffer, Rotarix 106.5 CCID50
stored at 37°C for 7 days and reconstituted with buffer, placebo reconstituted with buffer, or placebo
reconstituted without buffer. Co-administration of routine vaccines was allowed. Feeding was
controlled as part of the study design.

20

Rota-048 (Finland): The primary objective was to compare the immunogenicity between the
lyophilized formulation of Rotarix and a new liquid formulation of Rotarix, as measured by vaccine
take. In addition, safety and reactogenicity of the formulations was assessed. Subjects 6-12 weeks
of age received one of the following regimens on a 0, 1-month schedule: Rotarix 106.5 CCID50 liquid
formulation, Rotarix 106.5 CCID50 lyophilized formulation, placebo liquid formulation, or placebo
lyophilized formulation. Co-administration of routine vaccines was not performed. Unrestricted
feeding was allowed.
Rota-060 (US): The primary objective was to demonstrate that co-administration with Rotarix did
not impair the immune response to all antigens contained in each of the routine infant vaccines
(Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB). In addition, safety (SAEs) and immunogenicty were assessed.
Subjects 6-12 weeks of age received one of the following regimens on a 0, 2-month Rotarix
schedule: Rotarix 106.5 CCID50 co-administered with routine vaccines or administered one month
apart from routine vaccines. All subjects received 3 doses of routine vaccines on a 0, 2, 4-month
schedule. Unrestricted feeding was allowed.
6.3

Review Strategy

This clinical review of Rotarix began with the review of the Clinical Overview (m2.5), Summary of
Clinical Efficacy (m2.7.3), Summary of Clinical Safety (m2.7.4), and the Tabular Listing of All
Clinical Studies (m5.2). Detailed reviews were then performed on the 4 BLA studies containing
efficacy data: Rota-023, Rota-036, Rota-004, and Rota-006. All efficacy, immunogenicity, and
safety reports from each of these studies were reviewed in detail. The reviewer also analyzed
demographic, dropout, and safety datasets provided by the applicant for these 4 studies using the
statistical software program JMP Version 6. In general, the design, conduct, and data analysis for
each trial appeared consistent and acceptable, and demographic and safety data obtained using
JMP were consistent with data presented in the study reports.
The Summary of Clinical Efficacy was then reviewed again to provide an overview of efficacy and
immunogenicity across all studies. This was followed by a second review of the Summary of Clinical
Safety which contained 2 integrated safety analyses based on data from 10 of the 11 BLA trials.
During these reviews, individual study reports from Rota-005 and Rota-060 were reviewed because
both trials involved U.S. subjects. The individual study report from Rota-033 was also reviewed
because this was a lot consistency study. For Rota-005, Rota-033, and Rota-060, safety and
immunogenicity were reviewed, and demographic, dropout, and safety datasets were reviewed
using JMP 6. For Rota-005 and Rota-033, virus shedding datasets were reviewed using JMP 6.
Overall, the integrated efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety reports were adequately presented,
with no data inconsistencies across studies. Rota-005, Rota-033, and Rota-060 also appeared to
have been designed and conducted in an acceptable manner. During the overview of clinical
efficacy and clinical safety, the reviewer also referred to specific information in the reports of the
other BLA studies (Rota-007, Rota-014, Rota-039, Rota-048) when needed.
Next, post-marketing safety data was reviewed in the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)
(m5.3.6). A list of SAEs from non-BLA studies (m5.3.5.3) was also reviewed, as was an analysis of
Kawasaki reports following Rotarix (m5.3.5.4).
The Rotarix United States Risk Management Plan (m1.16) was then reviewed. As part of the
review, protocols for the PASS study in Mexico, Rotavirus Surveillance in Europe, Rota-022, Rota054, and Rota-056 were also reviewed.
In general, all study reports adequately referenced published literature to support efficacy,
immunogenicity, and safety findings.
The package insert and patient information sheet was then reviewed with several other CBER
reviewers, and revisions and comments were forwarded to the applicant during the review cycle.

6.4

Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and Data Integrity

All studies were conducted by experienced investigators in accordance with standard operating
procedures of the GSK Group of Companies, which comply with the principles of GCP, and in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1996. All studies were also conducted with the
approval of Ethics Committees or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Regulatory approval was
obtained from the relevant health authority when required. All laboratory assays were performed at
GSK Biologicals’ central laboratory or in a validated laboratory designated by GSK Biologicals using
standard, validated procedures with adequate controls. Adherence to protocol requirements and
verification of data generation accuracy was achieved through monitoring visits to each investigator
site. Computer checks and blinded review of subject tabulations were performed to ensure
consistency of CRF/eCRF completion and source documents/data.
Informed consent
Written Informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of each subject prior to the
performance of any study-specific procedures.
Protocol violations, Site-specific issues, Data integrity
Bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) inspections at six sites (1 site each in Mexico, Honduras, and Brazil;
3 sites in Finland) did not reveal any major violations or other site-specific issues that would have
affected data integrity of the studies. Please refer to CBER’s BIMO reports for more details.
6.5

Financial Disclosures

A Financial Disclosure Statement (m1.3.4), including form FDA 3454, was submitted with the BLA.
The applicant stated that none of the clinical investigators had any financial interests or
arrangements in any of the studies or the applicant itself. A list of investigators with no disclosable
financial interests/arrangements was provided for each study. In addition, a list of investigators
whose updated financial interests/arrangements could not be obtained was provided for each study.
Information could not be obtained from these investigators mainly because they could not be
located. However, several refused to provide this information.

Human Pharmacology (Immunogenicity, Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics)

Overall, Rotarix at the proposed licensing potency was highly immunogenic, as demonstrated by
anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs and vaccine take. Please refer to section 8.1 for
review of immunogenicity data from Rota-023 (8.1.1), Rota-036 (8.1.2), Rota-004 (8.1.3), and Rota006 (8.1.4) of this review. Please also refer to section 9.1 for an overview of immunogenicity data
across the BLA studies

90% power to conclude
2. Amendment 2 – January 23, 2004
a. Severe GE cases to be collected through active hospital surveillance and complemented,
when needed, by subject surveillance
b. IS surveillance to be done similarly to severe GE surveillance and complemented by SEROEPI-204 or similar local IS surveillance programs
c. Interval window for stool collection widened to 7 days after admission to a medical
facility/hospital
d. Costa Rica not participating in study
e. Statistical analysis section on safety adapted to reflect recommendation from IDMC
statistician
f. Upper age limit for Dose 1 extended to 13 weeks in Chile (Country-specific amendment for

Visits 1 & 2 – days of vaccination
Subset A – safety and Year 1 efficacy cohort
Subset B (subset of subset A) – safety and Year 2 efficacy cohort
Contact – site visit, telephone contact, or home visit by investigator, study nurse, or qualified health worker

All subjects were followed for SAEs at Visits 2 and 3. Subjects in subset A were monitored also for
SAEs at Visit 4 and severe GE episodes at Visits 2, 3, and 4. Subset B subjects were further
monitored for SAEs and severe GE episodes at Contacts 1 and 2 and Visits 5 and 6.
Subjects received a physical examination at each visit. Prior/concomitant medications and
vaccinations will be recorded at Visits 1, 2, and 3.
Pre-vaccination blood samples were obtained from a subset of subjects (approximately 100 per
country except Finland) at Visit 1. A subset of subjects also provided post-vaccination blood
samples at Visit 3.
Severe GE Case Ascertainment
Follow-up of severe GE episodes for efficacy assessment was performed from Dose 1 until the last
planned visit. Parents/guardians/caretakers of subjects were instructed to seek medical advice at
the nearest hospital/medical facility if symptoms of severe GE developed, and to contact the
investigator.
In addition, study personnel performed hospital or medical facility surveillance for severe GE cases
by contacting or visiting each medical facility at least twice per week. Furthermore, subject
surveillance by telephone, home visit, or other method was performed by non-medical study
personnel, at minimum intervals of 4 days, to identify severe GE cases not initially been identified
by medical facility surveillance (e.g. subjects treated in facilities outside the surveillance system).
Severe GE cases were also ascertained by medical history at planned study visits and contacts
(see table above). Cases elicited by medical history but not by hospital surveillance were confirmed
by review of medical facility records.
All identified cases of severe GE were included in the final analysis.
Severe GE Case Follow-Up
Subjects hospitalized or treated for re-hydration at a medical facility for a GE episode were followed
by study personnel. For each severe GE episode, a GE diary card should be completed daily by
parent/guardian, nurse, and/or health care worker until 2 days after loose stools and vomiting have
disappeared. The GE diary card allowed assessment of severe GE intensity using a 20-point
(Vesikari) scale that graded duration and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting, degree of fever,
dehydration and hospitalization. When counting episodes of looser than normal stools or vomiting, a
missing value on a specific day was considered as absence of episodes for that day. Also, in
classifying the degree of dehydration, a subject was considered 1-5% dehydrated if oral rehydration
was received, and ≥ 6% if hospitalized occurred and/or IV rehydration was received.
For each severe GE episode, a stool sample was collected as soon as possible and no later than 7
days after admission to a medical facility for re-hydration treatment. A second stool sample was
collected if the first sample was insufficient. Stool samples were submitted, aliquoted and stored per
standard protocols.

27

Stool samples were analyzed by ELISA at the GSK laboratory (Belgium) to determine the presence
of RV. If RV was detected, specimens were analyzed by RT-PCR for serotype determination. If G1
RV was detected, differentiation of vaccine from wild type virus was done using sequence analysis
and/or hybridization ----------------------------------. Fresh stool samples were also tested
locally for bacterial and parasitic enteric pathogens to identify mixed infections.
IS Case Ascertainment
SAEs were recorded throughout the study period, starting from the administration of Dose 1.
Parents/guardians/caretakers of subjects were instructed to contact the investigator and to seek
medical advice at the nearest hospital if the following sign/symptoms of IS developed: severe
colicky abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating, fever up to 41°C). IS
cases were ascertained by medical history at planned study visits and contacts. All hospitals were
aware of the trail, with relevant departments advised to contact study personnel for each case of IS.
All IS cases were re-captured independently from this study by means of a GSK sponsored
prospective IS study (SERO-EPI-IS-204) or similar country-specific surveillance programs. The
objective of this study was to estimate background incidence of IS among children less than 2 years
of age in the population where the vaccine study took place. Study personnel/health workers
performed hospital surveillance for IS by contacting or visiting hospitals qualified to provide IS
treatment in the study area at least twice per week (weekly in Finland). This GSK surveillance
program gradually concluded after all Visit 4s were completed.
A check for consistency was performed regularly between the two ascertainment methods (medical
history and hospital surveillance). All definite IS cases identified by either system were included in
the final analysis.
IS Case Review and Follow-Up
All cases of IS were evaluated according to standard procedures (Appendix L, Rota-023 Visit 1-3
protocol). The diagnosis of IS was to have been documented by radiography, with documentation
by ultrasonography dependent on available expertise. Several biological samples were collected for
all IS cases, including stool samples, rectal swabs, and throat swabs for RV, enteroviruses and
adenoviruses, acute and convalescent serum samples for immune response to RV and other
pathogens as needed, surgical specimens (if available). Testing was conducted at the following
external and independent designated laboratories via GSK laboratory: Laboratory ---------------(PCR for RV, enteroviruses, adenoviruses), ------------------- (PCR for shigella, salmonella,
campylobacter), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (PCR and -------------- on surgical
biopsies for RV, enteroviruses, adenoviruses), and Delft Diagnostic Laboratory, Netherlands (RTPCR for RV G type, hybridization assay to differentiate RV vaccine vs wild-type). In addition, fresh
stool samples were also tested locally for bacterial and parasitic enteric pathogens.
The case definitions for definite, probable, possible and suspected IS developed by the Brighton
Collaboration Intussusception Working group were applied (Appendix I, Rota-023 Visit 1-3
protocol). The definition of a definite case of IS was as follows:
Level 1 of Evidence (Definite)
Surgical criteria
The demonstration of invagination of the intestine at surgery,
AND/OR
Radiological criteria
The demonstration of invagination of the intestine by either gas or liquid contrast enema,
Or
The demonstration of an intra-abdominal mass by abdominal ultrasound with specific characteristic
features* that is proven to be reduced by hydrostatic enema on post-reduction ultrasound

28

AND/OR
Autopsy criteria
The demonstration of invagination of the intestine.
* target sign or doughnut sign on transverse section and a pseudo-kidney or sandwich sign on longitudinal section.
(Source: Rota-023 Protocol or Amendment Year 1, pg 134)

In order to capture all IS events, IS cases were reported irrespective of whether or not the Brighton
Case Definition was met.
In the protocol, it was originally specified that a Clinical Events Review Committee (CEC),
consisting of physicians acting as consultants with particular expertise, would perform blinded
objective reviews of all IS cases, independent from the IDMC. CEC members were not study
investigators or medical care providers to study subjects. However, as stated in the Year 1 Study
Report, a GSK physician rather than the CEC reviewed IS cases diagnosed after Visit 3 up to Visit
4 using the same case definition for definite IS mentioned above.
Other AE/SAE Monitoring
Parents/guardians of each subject were instructed to contact the investigator immediately for any
perceived serious signs or symptoms. Subjects hospitalized for an SAE were followed by study
personnel. SAEs were ascertained by medical history at planned study visits and contacts. In
addition, all AEs leading to subject withdrawal or drop out will be recorded.
Intensity and causality were evaluated for all SAEs and AEs leading to subject withdrawal or drop
out using standard criteria. Follow-up of these subjects continued until the AE resolved, subsided,
stabilized, disappeared, the event was otherwise explained, or the subject was lost to follow-up.
SAEs were reported by the investigators to GSK within 24 hours of awareness of the events.
Because many study fatalities had more than one SAE, an independent Safety Review Committee
performed blinded reviews of all fatalities that occurred during the study period, and assessed the
cause of death (primary cause of death, secondary diagnoses, underlying diagnoses). The primary
cause of death was used for all mortality analyses.
Signs, symptoms, and diagnoses of SAEs were coded and summarized according to Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification. System Organ Class (SOC) and
Preferred Terms (PT) obtained from the verbatim of the investigators were used for SAE analyses,
including IS and fatal cases.
Serology Analysis
Sera were collected from a subset of 100 subjects per study country (except Finland) at Visit 1 (preDose 1) and Visit 3 (post-Dose 2). Anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations were measured by ELISA at
a GSK designated laboratory. The assay cut-off was 20 U/ml. Geometric Mean Concentrations
(GMCs) calculations were also performed.
Forms
1. GE diary card: completed daily (by parent/guardian, nurse, and/or health care worker) until 2
days after loose stools and vomiting have disappeared, for each severe GE episode during the
study period
2. Electronic Case Report Form (CRF): included all reviewed severe GE cases, information from
GE diary cards, local laboratory results of stool analysis, IS/SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal or
drop out, prior/concomitant medications or vaccinations
3. SAE Report Form
4. Standard Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)
An IDMC was charged with monitoring the safety aspects of the Rotarix clinical development. The
IDMC conducted unblinded reviews of all SAEs and other relevant safety data, including

29

withdrawals due to AEs. A safety boundary, applied to definite IS cases reported within 31 days
post-vaccination, was established to recommend a clinical study hold if necessary (Table 1 in Rota023 Visit 1-3 protocol).
8.1.1.1.7

Statistical Considerations

Power Considerations - Primary Efficacy Objective
Assuming a true VE of 70% and an incidence rate of severe RV GE of 1.5% during the 1st efficacy
period (Year 1), and 9,000 subjects in each treatment arm, the study had 83.3% power to observe a
lower limit of the VE 95% CI > 50%.
Power Considerations - Primary Safety Objective
An overall IS incidence rate of 1/10,000 vaccinees, which was based on a consensus estimate of
Rotashield attributable risk, was revised based on the total observed IS cases that occurred during
Rota-023. Therefore, the overall definite IS incidence rate, which was further substantiated by data
from active IS surveillance in the same 11 Latin American countries participating in Rota-023, was
revised to 3-5/10,000. This subsequently led to revision of criteria for meeting the following primary
safety objective:
-

The upper limit of the 95% CI of the risk difference for definite IS should be <6/10,000
There should be no statistically significant increase in the incidence of definite IS (the lower
limit of the 95% of the risk difference should be < 0)

Assuming a definite IS incidence rate of 3-5/10,000 in the placebo group and 30,000 subjects in
each treatment arm, the study had >86% power to meet its primary objective if the risk difference
was truly 0. (Amended May 19, 2004, before the last Visit 3 in July 2004)
Power Considerations – 2nd Efficacy Follow-up Objectives
Assuming a true VE of 60% and an incidence rate of severe RV GE of 1% during the second
efficacy period (Year 2), and 5,600 subjects in each treatment arm, the study had 95.2% power to
observe a LL of the VE 95% CI > 0%, and 89.9% power for a LL >10%.
Study Cohorts
Total vaccinated cohorts (TVCs) consisted of all subjects in the IS Safety study, Year 1 Efficacy
study, and Year 2 Efficacy study, that were administered at least one vaccine/placebo, and
underwent the following analyses:
- IS and SAE safety analysis from Dose 1 to Visit 3
- Secondary efficacy analyses for Year 1 (TVC, 1st year efficacy subset)
- Secondary efficacy analyses for Year 2 (TVC, 2nd year efficacy subset)
- Efficacy from Dose 1 to Visit 6 (TVC, 1st year efficacy subset)
- Analysis of definite IS from Dose 1 to Visit 4 (TVC, 1st year efficacy subset)
- Analysis of definite IS from Dose 1 to Visit 6 (TVC, 2nd year efficacy subset)
- Safety analysis for Year 1 (TVC subset Year 1)
- Safety analysis for Year 2 (TVC subset Year 2)
The TVC for immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects in the TVC who had immunogenicity data.
The ATP safety cohort consisted of vaccinated subjects who 1) received at least 1 dose of
vaccine/placebo, 2) did not have their randomization codes broken, 3) did not receive a vaccine
forbidden by or not specified in the protocol, and 4) did not receive a replacement vial. The ATP
safety cohort was to be performed if needed.
The ATP efficacy cohort consisted of all subjects from the ATP safety cohort who 1) belonged to
subsets A and/or B, 2) received 2 doses of vaccine/placebo, 3) entered the first efficacy (subset A)
and second efficacy (subset B) follow-up periods, 4) did not have their randomization codes broken
before the end of Year 1 efficacy follow-up, and 5) did not have rotavirus other than vaccine strain
in GE stool samples collected between Day 0 (Dose 1) and 2 weeks post-Dose 2. (Amended on

30

September 14, 2004, date of last Visit 4) The ATP efficacy cohort was used for the primary efficacy
analysis for the Year 1 efficacy follow-up period (2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 4), Year 2 efficacy
follow-up period (after Visit 4 up to Visit 6), and the combined efficacy follow-up period (2 weeks
post-Dose 2 to Visit 6).
The ATP immunogenicity cohort consisted of all subjects from the ATP safety cohort who 1) did not
receive forbidden medications per protocol 2) did not have underlying medical conditions forbidden
per protocol 3) had no protocol violations of demographics 4) complied with study vaccination
schedule 5) complied with blood sampling schedule 6) had immunogenicity data at pre- and postsampling time points 7) had no rotavirus other than vaccine strain in GE stool samples collected up
to Visit 3 8) had no concomitant infections unrelated to the vaccine which may have influenced the
immune response and 8) were negative for serum anti-RV IgA antibodies on the day of Dose 1. The
ATP immunogenicity cohort was used for the primary immunogenicity analysis.
Final Analyses
The final statistical analysis for the primary safety objective was performed after all subjects
completed Visit 3. Final analysis for primary efficacy and other objectives involving the period from
Visit 1 to Visit 4 was performed after all subjects completed Visit 4. Data analysis from the end of
the 1st efficacy follow-up period to the end of the 2nd efficacy follow-up period was later performed.
SAEs corresponding to the primary safety objective (i.e. IS) were not unblinded until all subjects
completed their Visit 3. At the time of the final safety analysis for data reported from Dose 1 to Visit
3, all subjects from the safety cohort only (~40,000), all subjects in the safety/efficacy cohort (subset
A) who reported an SAE during this period, and all fatal subjects (up to the September 2004 lock
point) were unblinded for analysis. Drop-outs due to non-SAEs were not unblinded.
Investigators were unblinded to subjects that reported SAEs from Dose 1 to Visit 3 after receiving a
copy of the final safety report for this period on November 18, 2004. Data up to Visit 4 were
reviewed and frozen before unblinding of subjects with SAEs from Dose 1 up to Visit 3 for this
safety report.
For the final analysis of data up to Visit 4, only efficacy subset subjects who reported an SAE after
Visit 3 up to Visit 4 and fatal cases (up to the December 2004 lock point) were unblinded. Access to
individual unblinding for the remaining subjects in subset A was limited to the statistician and
database administrator until completion of the 2nd year of efficacy follow-up. The study was subjectblinded only during Year 2 efficacy follow-up.
The following analyses were performed:
1. Demographics: age (mean, median, range, and SD per group) at specific time points, racial and
gender composition; length of intervals between specific time points; drop-outs at Visit 4 and
Visit 6 by reason
2. Efficacy:
a. VE against severe wild-type RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 1 year of age
b. VE against severe G1 wild-type RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 1 year of age
c. VE against severe non-G1 RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 1 year of age
d. VE against severe RV GE due to each non-G1 serotype from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 1
year of age
e. VE against severe wild-type RV GE with a score of ≥ 11 on the 20-point Vesikari scale from
2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 1 year of age
f. VE against severe wild-type RV GE in a subset of subjects during Year 2 follow-up
g. VE against severe wild-type RV GE in a subset of subjects during Year 2 follow-up
VE after Dose 1 was also calculated for the 6 endpoints noted above. Other supportive and exploratory
analyses were performed (e.g. VE by country, VE against severe GE, time-to-event analysis – Cox
proportional hazard model, sub-analyses for 2nd year efficacy).

31

For all VE analyses, a GE episode without a stool sample or available result was not considered as
a RV GE episode.
3. Safety
a. Asymptotic standardized 95% CI for group difference and 2-sided asymptotic score test for
the null hypothesis of identical incidence in both groups for:
- SAEs between groups throughout the study, including fatal cases and SAEs/non-SAEs
leading to drop-out
b. Asymptotic standardized 95% CI for treatment group difference for:
- % difference in subjects with definite IS within 31 days after any dose between vaccine
and placebo groups
- % difference in subjects with definite IS within 31 days after each dose between vaccine
and placebo groups
- % difference in subjects with definite IS from Visit 1 to Visit 3
- % difference in subjects with definite IS from Visit 1 to Visit 4 (subset A)
- % difference in subjects with definite IS from Visit 1 to Visit 6 (subset B)
Asymptotic standardized 95% on the relative risk was also calculated for Endpoints 1 and 2
above. Of note, p-values were be adjusted for the number of safety endpoints. Multiplicity
adjustment was not performed.
4. Immunogenicity (for each country and pooled countries, at each time point):
a. Seroconversion rates and 95% CI, by group
b. GMCs and 95% CIs, by group
Immunogenicity analysis will not be performed before final efficacy analysis of the 1st efficacy
follow-up period in order to avoid unblinding. Immunogenicity analyses excluded subjects with
missing or non-evaluable measurements.
Interim Analyses
For regulatory purposes, an interim safety analysis (which also served as the final analysis of the
primary safety objective) for SAEs up to Visit 3 was performed on the entire study cohort when all
subjects completed Visit 3. The same analytical methodologies described above in section 3a were
used. Definite IS cases diagnosed within 31 days after any Rotarix/placebo dose were unblinded
after all subjects completed Visit 3.
A second interim safety analysis, which also served as the final analysis of SAEs from Dose 1 to
Visit 3 and fatal cases up to the data lock point (September 10, 2004), was performed for regulatory
purposes. All subjects from the safety-only cohort, all subjects in the efficacy cohort who had an
SAE during the stated interval, and all fatal cases were unblinded.
An interim efficacy analysis was performed on data from Nicaragua for regulatory purposes.
Precautions were taken to maintain blinding during this analysis. No study report was written.
Additional analyses/changes
The following analyses that were not part of the final protocol and analysis plan were added:
- For ATP efficacy cohort, seasonal distributions of severe GE and RV GE episodes from 2
weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 4 displayed by country
- For ATP efficacy cohort, VE against hospitalization due to RV GE caused by circulating wildtype RV strains form 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 4
- For ATP efficacy cohort, VE against severe RV GE due to main G serotypes with a score of
≥ 11 on the Vesikari scale from 2 weeks-post Dose 2 to Visit 4
- For ATP efficacy cohort, VE against severe RV GE with a score ≥ a specific value on the
Vesikari scale from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 4
- Safety analyses after Visit 3 up to Visit 4 using subjects in the TVC (1st year efficacy subset)
that had a contact during this interval

32

-

2-sided asymptotic 90% CI for group difference for % of subjects reporting definite IS cases
diagnosed within 31 days after any dose between treatment groups (to assess original criteria of
UL of 90%CI <2/10,000 for primary safety objective)
2-sided exact p-value (because for few events, the asymptotic p-value is an underestimation
of the true p-value)
Analysis on specific pooled MedDRA PTs
Sub-group analysis according to age at dose 1 (<57 days, 57-84 days, >84 days), country,
gender, and time following vaccination
Differences in hospitalization rates due to SAEs between groups
Safety analyses after Visit 4 up to Visit 6 using subjects in the TVC (2nd year efficacy subset)
that had a contact during this interval
For ATP cohorts (2nd year efficacy subset), VE against hospitalization due to RV GE and against
hospitalization due to all cause GE, during each efficacy follow-up period
For ATP cohorts (2nd year efficacy subset), VE against severe RV type G GE with a score of
≥ 11 on the Vesikari scale, during each efficacy follow-up period
For ATP cohorts (2nd year efficacy subset), VE against severe RV GE with a score ≥ a
specific value on the Vesikari scale during the combined efficacy follow-up period
For the TVC (1st year efficacy subset), VE from Dose 1 to Visit 6

Protocol deviations – TVC for 1st year efficacy subset
- 1 subject did not receive any dose of Rotarix; therefore, 20,169 subjects were included in
this subset
Protocol deviations – TVC for 1st year safety
- 1,895 (Rotarix-926, placebo-969) subjects did not have a follow-up contact beyond Visit 3;
therefore, 18,274 subjects were included in this subset
Protocol deviations – ATP cohort for 1st year efficacy
The following is a summary of protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the ATP cohort:
- 475 (Rotarix-239, placebo-236) received OPV within 2 weeks of study dose
- 11 (Rotarix-2, placebo-9) had randomization code broken due to IS (placebo-5) within 31
days after study dose and due to vaccine-related AE (Rotarix-2, placebo-4)
- 13 (Rotarix-8,placebo-5) received study dose not administered per protocol
- 1573 (Rotarix-797, placebo-776) did not receive Dose 2
- 218 (Rotarix-101, placebo-117) did not enter into the surveillance period for efficacy followup (i.e. 2 weeks post-Dose 2)
- 12 (Rotarix-3, placebo-9) had GE stool samples positive for non-vaccine RV strain between
Dose 1 and 2 weeks post-Dose 2
Therefore, 17,867 subjects were included in the 1st year ATP efficacy cohort.
Protocol deviations – ATP cohort for immunogenicity
The following is a summary of protocol deviations that led to subject exclusion from this ATP cohort
(number of subjects originally planned for this cohort = 1013):
- 147 (Rotarix-61, placebo-76) were positive for serum anti-RV IgA at Dose 1 or their IgA
status was unknown at Dose 1
- 2 (Rotarix-1, placebo-1) received a medication forbidden by the protocol

34

-

2 (Rotarix-0, placebo-2) had GE stool samples positive for non-vaccine RV strain between
Visit 1 to Visit 3
4 (Rotarix-1, placebo-3) were non-complaint with vaccination schedule (received Dose 2
outside 21-90 day interval between vaccinations)
27 (Rotarix-12, placebo-15) were non-compliant with blood sampling schedule
91 (Rotarix-46, placebo-45) were missing post-vaccination serology results (mainly because
of invalid results or no blood sample collected)
6 (Rotarix-3, placebo-3) did not complete vaccinations but had serological data at Visit 3

Therefore, 734 subjects were included in the ATP immunogenicity cohort.
Subjects with SAEs from Visits 1 to 3 were not excluded from ATP cohorts for randomization code
broken (because codes weren’t broken before Visit 4).
A few minor protocol deviations were observed with respect to vaccine administration in the subset
A efficacy cohort, and are mentioned in section 8.1.1.2.3 of this report. None of these subjects
reported SAEs between Dose 1 and Visit 4.
Study demographics – ATP efficacy cohort (N=17,867)
Demographic characteristics are included in the table below. The median ages at Dose 1 (8 weeks),
Dose 2 (16 weeks), and Visit 4 (12 months) were the same between groups. Most of the subjects in
either group were Hispanic. The female-to-male ratios were comparable between groups.

Protocol deviations – TVC for 2nd year efficacy subset
- Of the 20,170 subjects enrolled in the 1st year efficacy subset, 4,987 subjects (Rotarix-2491,
placebo-2496) did not satisfy eligibility criteria for the 2nd year efficacy subset; thus 15,183
subjects were included in the TVC for 2nd year efficacy subset
Protocol deviations – TVC for 2nd year safety
- Of 15,183 subjects in the TVC for 2nd year efficacy subset, 54 subjects (Rotarix-33, placebo24) did not have a follow-up contact beyond Visit 4 and were therefore excluded from the
TVC for safety follow-up after Visit 4 up to Visit 6. Therefore, 15,129 subjects were included
in the TVC for 2nd year safety.
Protocol deviations – ATP cohort for efficacy during combined efficacy period
- 3851 (Rotarix-1804, placebo-1777) from the ATP cohort during the 1st year efficacy period
did not satisfy eligibility criteria for the 2nd year efficacy subset and were excluded from the
ATP cohort for efficacy during the combined period. Therefore, 14,286 subjects were
included in this cohort.
Protocol deviations – ATP cohort for efficacy during 2nd efficacy period
- 49 (Rotarix-30, placebo-19) did not enter the 2nd efficacy follow-up period and were excluded

Clinical characteristics of severe RV GE episodes
Clinical characteristics of severe RV GE episodes (duration/maximum # of loose stools,
duration/maximum # of vomiting episodes, maximum fever, treatment, % dehydration), between
treatment groups were similar overall.
Enteric pathogens testing
Although the protocol did not require enteric pathogen testing of stool specimens, 3 (Rotarix) and
38 (placebo) RV-positive stool specimens were tested. Enterotoxigenic E. coli was detected in 1
Rotarix specimen and 2 placebo specimens; E. histolytica was detected in 1 Rotarix specimen.
Vaccine efficacy against severe RV GE – Year 1 (Primary endpoint)
VE of Rotarix against severe RV GE caused by circulating wild-type RV during Year 1 follow-up
was 84.7%. The primary efficacy objective was reached because the lower limit of the 95% CI was
greater than 50% (refer to section 8.1.1.1.7 of this report on power considerations). VE was also
84.8% (95%CI: 72.0-91.7%) using the Cox proportional-hazard model.

pooled non-G1 types was 75.5% (95% CI: 51.0-87.6%) using the Cox proportional hazard model.
Although fewer G2 episodes occurred in the Rotarix group, VE did not reach statistical significance.
VE against G4 type was not evaluated due to limited subjects (Rotarix-1, placebo-2).

VE against severe RV GE with a Vesikari score ≥ 11 – Year 1 (Secondary endpoint)
VE against severe RV GE defined as a Vesikari score ≥ 11 was 84.8%, nearly identical to the VE
calculated against severe RV GE using the primary efficacy clinical case definition. VE against G1,
G2, G3, G9, and pooled non-G1 types were also consistent with VE figures using the primary
clinical case definition (see table above).

Year 1 Efficacy Study (Dose 1 to Visit 4) – TVC 1st year efficacy subset
Summary of reported severe RV GE episodes
A total of 112 subjects in the TVC efficacy subset reported one episode of severe RV GE from Dose
1 to Visit 4; 18 (0.2%) occurred in Rotarix recipients and 94 (0.9%) occurred in placebo recipients.
No subject in either group had more than one RV GE episode. Stool results were not available for
29 (11.7%) Rotarix and 67 (15.9%) recipients who reported severe GE episodes during this interval.
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to Visit 4
VE against severe RV GE occurring from Dose 1 to Visit 4 was 81.1% (95% CI: 68.5-89.3%),
indicating that Rotarix was protective from Dose 1 onwards. This figure is comparable to the VE
estimate for the primary endpoint in the ATP cohort (84.7%). VE using the Vesikari scale definition for
severe RV GE (≥ 11 points) was 80.5% (95%CI: 67.0- 89.2%).
Similar to the ATP cohort, VE against wild-type G1, G3, G9, and pooled non-G1 types reached
statistical significance (86.6%, 73.7%, 91.0%, and 73.9%, respectively).
VE against severe RV GE was statistically significant in Colombia (100%), Honduras (100%),
Mexico (80.1%), Nicaragua (86.1%), Panama (100%), Peru (88.3%), and Venezuela (67.0%).
VE against all cause severe GE – Dose 1 to Visit 4
VE against severe GE of any cause was 40.8% (95%CI: 30.2-49.9%).
Year 1 Efficacy Study (Dose 1 to 14 days post-Dose 2) – TVC 1st year efficacy subset
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to 14 days post-Dose 2
VE against severe RV GE occurring from Dose 1 to 14 days post-Dose 2 was 60.6% (95% CI: -7.587.5%). As indicated by the 95% CI, VE for this period did not reach statistical significance,
although fewer Rotarix than placebo recipients reported episodes (6 vs 15).
Year 1 Efficacy Study (Dose 1 to pre-Dose 2) – TVC 1st year efficacy subset
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to pre-Dose 2
Similar to the VE during Dose 1 to 14 days post-Dose 2, VE during Dose 1 to pre-Dose 2 did not
reach statistical significance (50.7% (95% CI: -41.8-84.8), despite episodes occurring less in
Rotarix recipients (6 vs 12).
Year 1 Immunogenicity – ATP immunogenicity cohort
Anti-RV IgA immunogenicity was evaluated for both the ATP (N=734) and TVC cohorts. Due limited
numbers of subjects, correlation between seroconversion rates and protection against severe RV
GE could not be assessed.
Immunogenicity – ATP immunogenicity cohort
Anti-RV IgA seropositive rates and GMCs at both pre-Dose 1 and Visit 3 (1-2 months post-Dose 2)
are presented below. Post-Dose 2 seropositive rates and GMCs were significantly greater in the
Rotarix group compared to placebo.

Dose 1 to Visit 6 Efficacy Subset – TVC for 1st year efficacy subset (N=20,169)

A total of 2430 subjects in the TVC 1st year efficacy subset reported at least one episode of severe
RV GE from Dose 1 to Visit 6; 41 (0.4%) occurred in Rotarix recipients and 202 (2.0%) occurred in
placebo recipients. Stool results were not available for 59 (12.1%) Rotarix and 134 placebo (17.0%)
recipients.
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to Visit 6 (using Cox regression model)
VE for the TVC for the 1st year efficacy subset during the period from Dose 1 to Visit 6 was 80.3% (95%
CI: 72.4-85.9%). This figure was comparable to VE for the ATP efficacy cohort for the combined period.
VE against severe RV GE reached statistical significance in Argentina (61.8%), Brazil (70.8%), Colombia
(83.9%), Honduras (83.5%), Mexico (88.6%), Nicaragua (67.7%), Panama (100%), Peru (88.5%), and
Venezuela (79.3%).
VE against wild-type G1, G3, G4, G9, and pooled non-G1 types reached statistical significance
(81.9%, 74.4%, 60.9%, 88.9%, and 77.9%, respectively).
VE using the Vesikari scale definition for severe RV GE (≥ 11 points) was 81.3% (95%CI: 73.486.8%). VE increased with increasing total points, reaching 100% (95% CI: 72.5-100%) for severity
≥ 20 points. For severe RV GE ≥ 11 points, VE against wild-type G1, G3, G4, G9, and pooled nonG1 types reached statistical significance (81.7%, 76.7%, 60.9%, 90.0%, and 79.4%, respectively).
VE against hospitalized RV GE was 81.3% (95% CI: 72.3-87.3%).

Visit 3 were similar between groups. The median ages at Dose 1 and Dose 2, male-to-female ratio
and proportion of Hispanics and Caucasians were also similar between groups. In addition, 6% and
3% of subjects were co-administered routine vaccinations with Dose 1 and Dose 2, respectively.
Mexico and Peru enrolled the largest numbers of subjects (20.9% and 19%, respectively).

When the original criterion for the primary safety objective was used, i.e. the upper limit of the 2sided 90% CI of the Risk Difference below 2/10,000, the primary objective was still met (UL =
1.71/10,000); the risk difference was -0.32/10,000 with a lower limit of -2.41.
There were no apparent differences in onset interval from vaccination or median age at the time of IS
diagnosis between the groups (table below). Onset interval from 1-15 days was observed in 2 Rotarix
and 2 placebo recipients; all pertained to Dose 2. Onset interval from 16-30 days was observed in 4
Rotarix (1 after Dose 1) and 5 placebo recipients (2 after Dose 1). The most common symptoms in
both groups were vomiting, bloody stools and abdominal distension. One of the 3 cases diagnosed
after Dose 1 received Dose 2 without subsequent problems, with the other 2 remained in the study.
One of the 13 subjects dropped out of the study at Visit 3. Nine of the 13 cases underwent surgery; all
13 cases made complete recoveries.

Test results of biological specimens obtained from the 13 IS cases are summarized below. Of note,
shigella was detected in 11 cases (Rotarix-5, placebo-6). Detection of at least 2 pathogens
(including RV vaccine or RV wild-type strains) was observed in 9 cases (Rotarix-5, placebo-4).
Vaccine virus was detected in 3 Rotarix recipients (1 of which was detected by lymph node biopsy);
RV (wild-type vs vaccine not specified) was detected by bowel biopsy in 2 Rotarix recipients (one

Reviewer Note: One definite IS case had an onset on Day 29 but was confirmed diagnostically on
Day 31. If this case is included in the Days 0-30 analysis, then there would be 7 out of 31,673 Rotarix
cases (versus to 7 out of 31,552 placebo cases). The statistical reviewer calculated a risk difference
of -8.48 x107 with a 95% CI of -2.63/10,000 to 2.61/10,000, and a 90% CI of -2.14/10,000 to

Secondary Safety Endpoint – IS (Dose 1 until Visit 3)
A total of 25 definite IS cases adjudicated by the CEC were diagnosed from Dose 1 until Visit 3
(Rotarix – 9, placebo – 16). As depicted in the table below, there was no statistically significant
difference between Rotarix and placebo groups in the % of subjects diagnosed with definite IS
during this time period.

Of the 25 cases, 12 (Rotarix – 3, Placebo – 9) were diagnosed beyond Day 30 after vaccine or
placebo until Visit 3. There were no apparent differences in onset interval from vaccination or

51

median age at the time of IS diagnosis between the groups (table below). Onset interval from 31-60
days was observed in 2 Rotarix and 5 placebo recipients, onset interval from 61-90 days was
observed in 0 Rotarix and 3 placebo recipients, and onset interval > 90 days was observed in 1
Rotarix and 1 placebo recipient. The most common symptoms in both groups were vomiting and
bloody stools. Two of the 7 cases diagnosed after Dose 1 received Dose 2 without subsequent
problems. Ten of the 12 cases underwent surgery; 12 cases made complete recoveries and 1 case
recovered with sequelae (jejunum/distal ileum resection). One of the subjects dropped out.

Test results of biological specimens obtained from the 12 IS cases showed that shigella was
detected in 9 of the cases (Rotarix-2, placebo-7). Detection of at least 2 pathogens (including RV
vaccine and wild-type strains) was observed in 9 cases (Rotarix-2, placebo-7). Vaccine virus was
detected in 1 Rotarix recipient, while G1 wild type RV was found in 2 placebo cases (both in stool
and bowel biopsy specimens).
Of note, two other IS cases occurred that were not included in the IS analyses. The first case, a
Rotarix recipient who was diagnosed on Day 22 post-Dose 2, was adjudicated by the CEC as a
probable case due to a normal ultrasound and clinical improvement without treatment. Clinical signs
and symptoms of this patient consisted of vomiting, bloody mucous stools, abdominal pain,
irritability, and decreased bowel sounds; stool cultures were negative for shigella, salmonella, E.
coli, and campylobacter.
The second case, also a Rotarix recipient, was adjudicated by the CEC as a definite IS case, but was
not included in the analysis because the date of diagnosis occurred after Visit 3. Symptom onset
occurred 56 days after Dose 2, with the diagnosis of IS made 2 days later.
Secondary Safety Endpoint - All SAEs (Dose 1 to Visit 3)
The number of subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE from Dose 1 to Visit 3 was significantly
less in the Rotarix group compared to the placebo group (table below). The reported SAEs were
coded to 24 MedDRA SOCs and 265 PTs. None of the SAE PTs were reported at a rate ≥ 1% in
the Rotarix group.

Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer obtained the
following figures in the table below, with differences from the applicant highlighted in bold italics.
Because the numbers and percentages did not differ substantially from those provided by the
applicant, and the software programs used in the analyses of AEs may elicit some minor
differences between CBER and the applicant, the reviewer feels comfortable accepting the analysis

Primary SOCs gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations, metabolism and nutrition, and
vascular disorders were reported significantly less in the Rotarix group compared to the placebo
group. PTs diarrhea, vomiting, gastroenteritis and dehydration were also reported significantly less
in the Rotarix group than the placebo group. These favorable SOCs were primary driven by these
PTs (also hypovolemic shock which did not reach statistical significance), reflecting efficacy of
Rotarix against GE-related symptoms and complications.
The Primary SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was reported significantly more in the
Rotarix group compared to the placebo group. This imbalance was driven by the PT Urticaria, which
was also significantly higher in the Rotarix group (5 subjects) compared to placebo group (0
subjects). Four of the 5 subjects developed urticaria between 15 and 82 days after Dose 1; 1
subject developed urticaria after intake of an unspecified medication, while 2 developed urticaria
within 4 and 16 days after receiving DTPw vaccination. Moreover, these 4 subjects did not develop
urticaria after receiving Dose 2. The remaining fifth subject had onset 4 days after Dose 2. All 5
were judged as not being related to vaccination, and made complete recoveries. Based on these
individual case reviews and post-hoc analyses, the applicant concluded that the observed
imbalance was likely a chance finding and not clinical relevant.
The PT Convulsions was also reported significantly more in the Rotarix group (16) compared to the
control group (6), despite no imbalance for the SOC Nervous system disorders. Upon further
review, the applicant found that SAEs coded to multiple PTs related to convulsive disorders were
reported for different subjects and in some instances the same subject. After the convulsion
disorder-related PT terms Convulsions, Epilepsy, Grand mal convulsion, Status epilepticus, and
Tonic convulsion were combined, no statistical difference between groups was found (Rotarix – 20
subjects, placebo – 12 subjects; p=0.219). There was also no evidence of imbalances by age,
gender, and country. All episodes were assessed as not related to vaccination.
Among the subjects who experienced a convulsion-related episode within 31 days after any dose, 7
were Rotarix recipients (2 hours to 29 days after vaccination) and 9 were placebo recipients. Ten
cases occurred after Dose 1 (Rotarix – 5, placebo – 5); 1 Rotarix recipient had previous neonatal
hypoxia (and developed convulsions 2 hours after receiving Dose 1) and 2 had current conditions

54

(pneumonia/anemia/family history of epilepsy, hypocalcemia/hyponatremia). Six subjects had onset
after Dose 2 (Rotarix – 2, placebo – 4); 1 Rotarix recipient had previous neonatal hypoxia, 2
convulsion episodes 3 and 27 days post-Dose 2, and 1 grand mal convulsion 58 days post-Dose 1,
while the other Rotarix recipient (onset 6 days post-Dose 2) also had chronic malnutrition and
gastroenteritis.
Among the subjects with onsets beyond 31 days after any dose until Visit 3, 14 were in Rotarix
recipients (32 to 144 days after vaccination) and 3 were placebo recipients. Eleven subjects
developed convulsion occurred after Dose 1 (Rotarix – 10, placebo – 1); 5 Rotarix recipients had a
concurrent medical condition (anemia, Down’s syndrome, cellulitis, GE plus receiving
metoclopromide before convulsions). One Rotarix recipient had 2 episodes (46 and 56 days postDose 1). Six subjects had an episode after Dose 2 (Rotarix – 4, placebo – 2); 2 Rotarix recipients
had otitis media and 2 other Rotarix recipients had previously experienced multiple episodes of
convulsions.
Reviewer Note: The reviewer also explored rates of convulsion-related SAEs within the first 43
days after vaccination in each group. A significant imbalance was not observed (Rotarix – 12
[0.04%], placebo – 9 [0.03%]).
Based on these post-hoc analyses, the applicant concluded that the originally observed imbalance
of PT Convulsions was likely a chance finding and not clinical relevant.
Results of the SAE analyses for each country were in line with the overall SAE analyses.
Reviewer Note: The reviewer explored rates of SAE bronchitis in each group. After PTs Bronchitis
and Bronchitis acute were combined, an imbalance not favoring the Rotarix group was not
observed within 31 days post-vaccination (Rotarix- 24 [0.08%], placebo - 24 [0.08%]) or within 43
days post-vaccination (Rotarix – 34 [0.11%], placebo – 30 [0.10%]).
Reviewer Note: The reviewer explored rates of non-fatal SAE pneumonia in each group. After PTs
Pneumonia, Bronchopneumonia, Pneumonia cytomegalovirus, and Pneumonia viral were
combined, imbalances were not observed within 31 days post-vaccination (Rotarix- 148 [0.48%],
placebo - 154 [0.49%]) or within 43 days post-vaccination (Rotarix – 193 [0.61%], placebo – 194
[0.61%]).
Reviewer Note: The reviewer explored rates of GI bleeding not related to IS in each group. After
PTs Diarrhoea haemorrhagic, Gastritis haemorrhagic, and Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage
were combined, 4 Rotarix recipients compared to 0 placebo recipients reported at least one of
these PTs (Diarrhoea haemorrhagic: Rotarix – 2, placebo – 0). Of the 4 subjects, 3 were in the
analysis dataset provided by the applicant; all 3 had onset of illness within 31 days post-vaccination
(7 days, 20 days).
Secondary Safety Endpoint - SAEs leading to hospitalization (Dose 1 to Visit 3)
Results from a post-hoc analysis demonstrated that the number subjects with SAEs leading to
hospitalization from Dose 1 to Visit 3 were significantly less in the Rotarix group than the placebo
group (886 vs 1003, p=0.005). When hospitalized GE-related events were excluded from SOC
Infections and infestations, there was no major imbalance in the number of subjects hospitalized for
SAEs between groups (Rotarix -627, placebo – 654).
Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer obtained totals of
888 Rotarix and 1005 placebo recipients who were hospitalized for SAEs from Dose 1 to Visit 3. In
addition, although the applicant did not specifically state which GE-related events were excluded
from SOC Infections and infestations, the reviewer attempted to obtain numbers for hospitalized
non-GE-related events by excluding all PTs with “gastroenteritis,” “dysentery,” “amoebiasis,”
“ascariasis,” “enterocolitis,” “gastrointestinal infection,” “giardiasis,” and “parasitic infection
intestinal.” By excluding these PTs, the reviewer obtained a total of 627 Rotarix and 656 placebo
recipients who were hospitalized for non-GE-related SAEs during this interval. Because the
numbers did not differ substantially from those provided by the applicant, the reviewer feels
comfortable accepting the analysis submitted by the applicant.

55

Secondary Safety Endpoint - SAEs related to vaccination (Dose 1 to Visit 3)
The number of subjects that reported at least 1 SAE that was assessed as related to vaccination
from Dose 1 to Visit 3 were not significantly different among the groups (Rotarix – 21, placebo – 14,
p=0.241). These SAEs included 9 definite IS cases (Rotarix-5, placebo-4); 1 case in the Rotarix
group was diagnosed beyond 31 days after vaccination. There were also no significant differences
between groups when subject numbers were assessed by SOC and PT categories. Of the SAEs in
the Rotarix group not including IS, 9 of 15 were classified under PT Gastroenteritis (onset 0-34 days
after previous dose).
Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer obtained totals of
20 Rotarix and 14 placebo recipients who reported at least 1 vaccine-related SAE during this
interval. The reviewer obtained a total of 16 non-IS vaccine-related SAEs reported in the Rotarix
group, the same figure reported by the applicant.
Secondary Safety Endpoint - Deaths
A total of 99 deaths (Rotarix – 56, placebo – 43; p=0.198; table below) occurred up to September
10, 2004 (approximately 1.5 months after the last Visit 3); 84 had symptom onset before Visit 3
(Rotarix – 51, placebo 33; p=0.051) and 83 died before Visit 3. One death had symptom onset
before Dose 1 of Rotarix. Ninety of the 99 deaths had primary cause of deaths assigned with
definite/possible evidence (Rotarix – 52, placebo – 38; p=0.145). None of the fatalities were
assessed as related to vaccination.

All

Reviewer Note: The reviewer obtained the same “n” for each category in the table above. However,
subcategory “All” under Post Dose 1 and Post Dose 2 should be “All before visit 3.”
Among the 99 deaths, there was no significant difference between groups in the number of subjects
classified under each MedDRA SOC. Of the PT terms, Pneumonia was reported significantly more
in the Rotarix group than the placebo group (14 vs 5, p=0.04). Of these 19 PT Pneumonia deaths, 7
(Rotarix-5, placebo-2) had symptom onset within 31 days following study dose. Upon further review,
it was noted that 2 other pneumonia-related PTs, Bronchopneumonia and Pneumonia
cytomegalovirus, were reported under the same SOC Infections and infestations. Because the
etiologic pathogen was not recovered in all pneumonia-related deaths, the applicant conducted an
ad-hoc analysis by pooling these 3 PTs. When pooled, the number of deaths due to pneumonia
disease was not significantly different between groups (Rotarix – 16, placebo – 6; p=0.054). Of the
pooled pneumonia deaths with symptom onset occurring within 31 days after vaccination/placebo, 7
were in Rotarix (4-25 days post-vaccination) and 3 in placebo (2-25 days post-dose) recipients; 6 of
7 Rotarix and 2 of 3 placebo deaths were reported after Dose 1. A temporal association was not
clearly established when analyzing pneumonia onset by week for each group (Rotarix/placebo):
week 1 – 2/2, week 2 – 2/0, week 3 - 2/0, week 4 – 1/1. Of the pooled pneumonia deaths with

56

symptom onset occurring beyond 31 days after vaccination/placebo, 9 were in Rotarix (31-199 days
post-vaccination) and 3 in placebo (46-83 days post-dose) recipients; 5/9 Rotarix and 2/3 placebo
deaths were reported after Dose 1. None of the 22 pooled pneumonia deaths were assessed as
related to vaccination/placebo.
Reviewer Note: As discussed in the Executive Summary (section 3), the applicant appeared to
incorrectly calculate the p-value (p=0.054) for the difference in pneumonia-related PTs between
treatment groups. The CBER statistical reviewer obtained an exact p-value of 0.0345 and 0.0354 using
two methodologies. Also, of the pooled pneumonia deaths with symptom onset occurring within 43 days
after vaccination/placebo, 8 were in Rotarix and 3 in placebo recipients.
Additional exploratory analyses of SAE hospitalizations coded under the pooled pneumonia
category based on all pneumonia-containing PTs (within SOC Infections and infestations) showed
that there were no significant differences between groups in the number of subjects hospitalized for
pneumonia from Dose 1 to Visit 3 (Rotarix-277, placebo-273; p=0.90). Significant differences when
stratified by dose (post-Dose 1 vs post-Dose 2) and timing of hospitalization (within 31 days vs
beyond 31 days after each dose) were also not observed.
Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer obtained totals of
278 Rotarix and 274 placebo recipients who reported at least 1 PT pneumonia-related
hospitalization during this interval. Other discrepancies included totals for post Dose 2 (applicant:
Rotarix-92, placebo-96; reviewer: Rotarix-92, placebo-97), post-Dose 2 within 31 days (applicant:
Rotarix-49, placebo-56; reviewer: Rotarix-49, placebo-57). Because the numbers did not differ
substantially from those provided by the applicant, the reviewer feels comfortable accepting the
analysis submitted by the applicant.
In addition, there were no significant differences in the number of subjects with pooled pneumonia
SAEs from all pneumonia-containing PTs (within SOC Infections and infestations) between groups
when stratified by dose (post-Dose 1 vs post-Dose 2) and timing of onset (within 31 days vs beyond
31 days after each dose).
Reviewer Note: Discrepancies in numbers of Rotarix/placebo subjects for pneumonia-related PT
SAEs between the applicant’s and reviewer’s calculations are noted below. Because the numbers
did not differ substantially from those provided by the applicant, the reviewer feels comfortable
accepting the analysis submitted by the applicant.
Dose 1 to Visit 3
Applicant: Rotarix-280, placebo-277
Reviewer: Rotarix-284, placebo-280
Within 31 days post-Dose 2
Applicant: Rotarix-49, placebo-57
Reviewer: Rotarix-49, placebo-58
Beyond 31 days post-Dose 2
Applicant: Rotarix-43, placebo-41
Reviewer: Rotarix-45, placebo-43
Based on these individual reviews and post-hoc analyses, the applicant concluded that the
originally observed imbalance of PT Pneumonia was likely not clinical relevant due to the lack of
significant difference between groups when pneumonia-related PTs were pooled, the absence of a
clear temporal association between Rotarix and pneumonia, and lack of significant differences
between groups for pneumonia hospitalizations and non-fatal pneumonia SAEs.
Secondary Safety Endpoint - SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out
There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the frequencies of subjects who
dropped out at Visit 3 due to SAEs or non-SAEs. There were also no significant differences in the
frequencies of SAEs or non-SAEs leading to drop-out, among SOCs and PTs.

Additional analyses
The applicant performed analyses of deaths by age and gender at dose 1. The trend toward higher
mortality in Rotarix recipients was seen primarily in female infants who received Dose 1 at 57-84
days of age (Rotarix – 10, placebo – 2; p=0.023). The range of symptom onset interval from
vaccination in the Rotarix group was 13-199 days. However, for this particular stratum, there were
no significant differences between Rotarix and placebo groups in deaths with symptom onset that
occurred within 31 days of Dose 1 (2 vs 0, p=0.161). Deaths in this stratum were largely due to nonenteric infectious causes, especially pneumonia (Rotarix-6/10). No differences by country were
observed. Hospitalizations were also significantly less in females Rotarix than placebo recipients
(360 vs 419), as well as 57-84 day-old (at Dose 1) Rotarix recipients compared to the same aged
placebo recipients (282 vs 331).
Reviewer Note: The reviewer obtained the following figures below which differed from those
provided by the applicant. Because the numbers did not differ substantially from those provided by
the applicant, the reviewer feels comfortable accepting the applicant’s results.

Follow-up safety – TVC, Year 1 efficacy period
The TVC for safety (N=18,274) was used for the safety analysis after Visit 3 up to Visit 4. The TVC for
efficacy subset (N=20,169) was used for the IS analysis from Dose 1 to Visit 4.
SAEs – After Visit 3 up to Visit 4
The number of subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE after Visit 3 up to Visit 4 was significantly
less in the Rotarix group compared to the placebo group (468 vs 521; p=0.038). The reported SAEs
were coded to 19 different MedDRA SOCs and 164 PTs were analyzed for potential imbalances
between groups. All SAEs during this interval were assessed as not related to vaccination. The only
PTs reported at ≥ 1% in the Rotarix group were gastroenteritis (1.3%) and pneumonia (1.1%).
Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer obtained totals of
473 Rotarix subjects and 523 placebo subjects with at least 1 SAE from Visit 3 up to Visit 4, and
SAEs coded to 165 PTs. Because the numbers did not differ substantially from those provided by the
applicant, the reviewer feels comfortable accepting the applicant’s analysis.
Among the SOCs, a significant risk difference between groups was only observed for the SOC
Infections and infestations (Rotarix-352 subjects, placebo-444 subjects), in which the SAE risk in the
Rotarix group minus the placebo group was -110 per 10,000 subjects (p=0.000). This difference was
driven by the SAE risk difference under PT Gastroenteritis which favored the Rotarix group
(126.7/10,000 vs 214.6/10,000, p<0.001).
Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer obtained totals of
356 Rotarix subjects and 445 placebo subjects who reported at least 1 SAE in the SOC Infections
and infestations. Because the numbers did not differ substantially from those provided by the
applicant, the reviewer feels comfortable accepting the applicant’s results.
Among the other PTs, a significant risk difference was observed for PT Pyrexia (Rotarix- 8.7/10,000
vs 1.1/10,000, p=0.021). Individual review of these 9 cases by the applicant physician provided no
evidence that this difference was of clinical relevance; all occurred between 55 and 188 days postDose 2. No significant differences were observed for pneumonia-related, convulsion-related, or
skin-related PTs.
Four subjects who did not return for Visits 3 and 4 reported SAEs beyond their last contact; these
subjects were excluded from safety analyses.
Deaths – After Visit 3 up to Visit 4
Among subjects followed for efficacy, 4 deaths were reported beyond the September 10, 2004 lock
date (the date up until which time reported deaths were included in the report of the final safety data for

58

Visits 1 to 3), two in each group. The deaths in Rotarix recipients were coded to the PTs Postoperative
infection and Road traffic accident. Three of the subjects died after Visit 4. All deaths were assessed as
not related to vaccination.
Reviewer Note: The reviewer noted that one of the three cases that died after Visit 4 was included in
the Visit 3-Visit 4 category, while the other two cases were included in the Visit 4- Visit 6 category. In
addition, the reviewer noted that one SAE (PT Congestive cardiomyopathy) in a placebo recipient
who died after Visit 4 was included in the Visit 3-Visit 4 category.
Fourteen of the 15 deaths leading to drop-out at Visit 4 were reported before the September 10,
2004 lock date, and were therefore not described in this section.
SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out – After Visit 3 up to Visit 4
There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the frequencies of non-serious
AEs in the TVC for safety who dropped out after Visit 3 up to Visit 4. Only one subject (placebo)
withdrew due to a non-serious AE classified by MedDRA (PT – nasopharyngitis). There were also
no significant differences in the number of SAEs during this time period between the groups (table
below). Of the 16 subjects who dropped out due to SAEs, 15 were fatal. All fatal cases were
assessed as not related to vaccination. The one non-fatal case reported acute lymphocytic
leukemia that was also not related to vaccination.

Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer obtained 9 placebo
subjects with at least 1 SAE resulting in dropout. The reviewer was not able to capture 1 placebo
subject (PT Acute lymphocytic leukaemia) because this SAE occurred 81 days post-Dose 2 and
therefore occurred before Visit 3. Also, the reviewer was not able to capture a reported death of a
Rotarix subject (PT Ependymoma) because the onset of this SAE was on Day 0 post-Dose 1,
therefore occurring before Visit 3.
Definite IS – After Visit 3 up to Visit 4 (TVC for safety)
During this interval, three Rotarix recipients and 4 placebo recipients were diagnosed with definite
IS; the risk difference was not statistically significant (see table below). All IS cases were assessed
as not related to vaccination.

Follow-up safety – TVC, Year 2 efficacy period
The TVC for 2nd year safety (N=15,129) was used for the safety analysis after Visit 4 up to Visit 6.
The TVC for 2nd year efficacy subset (N=15,183) was used for the IS analysis from Dose 1 to Visit 6.
SAEs – After Visit 4 up to Visit 6
The number of subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE after Visit 4 up to Visit 6 was significantly
less in the Rotarix group compared to the placebo group (518 vs 590; p=0.010). The reported SAEs
were coded to 22 different MedDRA SOCs and 196 PTs were analyzed for potential imbalances
between groups. All SAEs during this interval were assessed as not related to vaccination. The only
SAE PTs reported in ≥ 1% of the Rotarix group were gastroenteritis (2.1%) and pneumonia (1.3%).
Among the SOCs, a significant risk difference between groups was only observed for the SOC
Infections and infestations, in which the SAE risk in the Rotarix group minus the placebo group was 119 per 10,000 subjects (p=0.001). This difference was driven by the SAE risk difference under PT
Gastroenteritis (213.5/10,000 vs 336.3/10,000, p<0.001) and PT Dengue fever (0/10,000 vs
6.7/10,000, p=0.024), both which favored the Rotarix group. Borderline significant difference was
observed for SOC Gastrointestinal disorders favoring the Rotarix group (risk difference= -17.8/10,000,
p=0.050), although there were no significant PTs in this SOC.
Among the other PTs, a significant risk reduction favoring the Rotarix group was observed for PT
Lymphadenopathy (Rotarix- 0/10,000 vs 5.3/10,000, p=0.043). No significant differences were
observed for pneumonia-related, convulsion-related, or skin-related PTs.
Of note, PT Kawasaki’s disease was reported in one Rotarix recipient. As described in the SAE report,
the patient was a 2 year-old female from Mexico who developed fever, skin spots, irritability and seizure
19 months post-Dose 2. Her clinical course was notable for persistence of fever and seizures, and she
developed respiratory failure. Aside from fever, typical clinical features of Kawasaki’s disease were not
described in the report.
Deaths – After Visit 4 up to Visit 6
Eleven deaths were reported during this interval (Rotarix-5, placebo-6). The deaths Rotarix
recipients were coded to the PTs Death, Aspiration/Asphyxia, Pneumonia aspiration,
Gastroenteriris/Septic shock, Skull fracture/Hepatic rupture, Meningitis bacterial, Road traffic

60

accident, and Congestive cardiomyopathy/Cardiac failure congestive. All deaths were assessed as
not related to vaccination.
Definite IS – After Visit 4 up to Visit 6 (TVC for 2nd year safety)
No IS cases were reported during this interval.
Definite IS – Dose 1 to Visit 6 (TVC for 2nd year efficacy subset)
During this interval, there was no increased risk of definite IS in the Rotarix group compared to the
placebo group.

SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out – After Visit 4 up to Visit 6
There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the frequencies of non-serious
AEs in the TVC for safety who dropped out after Visit 4 up to Visit 6. Among the non-serious AEs, 1
Rotarix recipient reported PT Asthma, while 1 placebo recipient each reported PT Tonsillitis and PT
Varicella. There were also no significant differences in the number of SAEs during this interval by
SOC and PTs. Of the 13 subjects who dropped out due to SAEs, 11 were fatal (Rotarix-5, placebo6). All fatalities were assessed as not related to vaccination.

Comments & Conclusions

In Rota-023, two doses of Rotarix at a potency of 106.5 CCID50 per dose, administered to children 6
to 13 weeks of age at 1-month or 2-month intervals, were efficacious (>84%) against severe RV GE
during the period from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 1 year of age. Efficacy results were consistent
using either of two case definitions for severe RV GE. Rotarix was also efficacious against G1 and
G9 wild-type strains (>90%). When all non-G1 types were pooled together, VE was over >75%.
Efficacy was also high from Dose 1 to 1 year of age (>80%), and remained high during the second
year of follow-up (79%).
An increased risk in definite IS was not seen within 31 days after any dose, nor during the first and
second year efficacy follow-up periods. Statistically significant differences in frequencies of SAEs
not favoring the Rotarix group were observed for non-fatal PT Convulsions and fatal PT
Pneumonia. When five convulsion-related PTs were pooled, a statistically significant difference was
not observed. When three pneumonia-related PTs were combined, the increase in frequency of
death in the Rotarix group remained statistically significant. However, less than half of the
pneumonia-related deaths had symptom onset within 31 days post-vaccination.

61

The validity of the results was strengthened by the double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center
study design. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity endpoints, case definitions, and study cohorts
were clearly defined and appropriate. There were no significant efficacy or safety differences by
country, although population sizes were limited in some countries. Overall, the study was wellconducted without major sources of biases. Data quality was acceptable, and appropriate data
analyses were conducted protocol and amendments. Protocol deviations were minor, occurred
infrequently, and did not lead to any SAEs. Subject dropouts and missing data were handled
appropriately and according to protocol.
The applicant stated that the proposed indication for Rotarix is the prevention of rotavirus
gastroenteritis caused by G1 and non-G1 types (including G2, G3, G4, G9). Results from Rota-023
support the use of Rotarix in the prevention of severe RV GE only. Efficacy data supports the use of
Rotarix in the prevention of severe RV GE caused by G1 types; VE was statistically significant for
Year 1, Year 2, and the combined efficacy periods. Efficacy data also supports the use of Rotarix in
the prevention of severe RV GE caused by non-G1 types when pooled together. However, when
VE was assessed for each type individually, Rotarix demonstrated statistically significant efficacy
against G9 types during all three study periods. Statistically significant efficacy against G3 types
was demonstrated during Year 1 and combined efficacy periods. However, the lower limits of the
95% CIs were very low. Efficacy against G4 types was not assessed during Year 1 due to limited
numbers of severe G4 RV GE; efficacy estimates during Year 2 and the combined efficacy periods
were 63.1% (LL of the 95% CI: 0.7) and 61.8% (LL of the 95% CI: 4.1%). Statistically significant
efficacy was not demonstrated against G2 types for any study period.

Design Overview

Rota-036 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-country and multi-center study.
Healthy subjects 6 to 14 weeks of age at the time of Dose 1 were randomized to receive 2 doses of
either Rotarix (106.5 CCID50) or placebo (2:1 ratio) on a 0, 1-month or 0, 2-month schedule. Subjects
were randomized and administered Dose 1 of Rotarix or placebo on the same day (i.e. Day 0). The
intended study duration was 22 to 24 months.
A total enrollment of 3990 subjects was targeted, of which 2490 were to have come from Finland,
with 300 subjects to have been enrolled in each of the remaining 5 countries.
For Finland, 300 subjects enrolled at specific centers comprised the immunogenicity- reactogenicity
subset, while in each of the other countries, the 300 enrolled subjects were part of this subset.
Rotarix/placebo and co-administered childhood vaccines were given according to national plans of
immunization in each country as follows:
- Czech Republic: 3, 4, 5 months

Vaccination with Rotarix or placebo took place at Visits 1 and 2. Subjects received a physical
examination at Visits 1, 2, and 3 (plus Visits 4 and 6 if requested). Prior/concomitant medications
and vaccinations will be recorded at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5 (plus Visits 4 and 6). Feeding practices will
be recorded at Visits 1 and 2.
Reactogenicity diary cards were collected at Visits 2 and 3. GE diary cards were collected at Visits
2 to 7 as needed.
Pre-vaccination blood samples were obtained from a subset of subjects (approximately 1800) at
Visit 1, while post-vaccination blood samples were drawn at Visit 3. For subjects in countries
(Finland, Italy, Spain) where Dose 3 of the routine vaccinations did not coincide with Visit 3, an
additional study visit for a 1 month post-Dose 3 blood sampling was performed if necessary as
follows (amended June 7, 2005):
- Finland: Visit 6 (13 months of age)
- Italy: Visit 6 (12 months of age)
- Spain: Visit 4 (7 months of age)
GE Case Ascertainment
Active case ascertainment for any GE episodes was conducted throughout the study. From Day 7 postDose 1 until the end of May 2005, each parent/guardian of a subject was contacted weekly by
telephone, short message service using cellular phone, an Independent Calling Center or other
convenient means. From June 2005 until December 1, 2005, contact occurred bi-weekly. From
December 2005 to the end of May 2006 (2nd RV epidemic season), weekly contact was resumed. From
June 2006 to the end of the study, bi-weekly contact was conducted.
GE Case Follow-Up
For each GE episode, a GE diary card should be completed daily by parents/guardians until the end
of the GE symptoms, and returned to the investigator at the following study visit. The GE diary card
allowed assessment of severe GE intensity using a 20-point (Vesikari) scale that graded duration
and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting, degree of fever, rehydration and other medication.
Procedures for categorizing dehydration status and handling of missing values of loose
stools/vomiting episodes were the same as in Rota-023. The diary card also allowed recording of
medical attention (medical provider contact/advice/visit, emergency room contact/visit,
hospitalization) and behavioral symptoms (normal, less playful/irritable, lethargic/listless, seizure)
and their duration.
In addition to the Vesikari scale, a 24-point Clark scoring system was used as an exploratory
measure of severe RV GE. This scale assigned points according to duration/intensity of diarrhea,
vomiting, and fever, and on intensity/duration of behavioral symptoms. A score of >16 points was
defined as severe GE.
For each GE episode, a stool sample was collected as soon as possible after onset but not later
than 7 days after illness onset. Samples were returned to the investigator on an ongoing basis.
Stool samples were tested for wild-type and vaccine RV strains using the same methods as in
Rota-023.
AE/SAE Monitoring, including IS
Solicited symptoms (fever, fussiness/irritability, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, cough/runny
nose) occurring from Day 0 to Day 7 after each dose were monitored in a subset of subjects using
diary cards.
Unsolicited symptoms occurring from Day 0 to Day 30 after each dose were recorded for all
subjects. SAEs occurring throughout the study period were recorded for all subjects.
For each solicited and unsolicited symptom, receipt of medical attention (defined as hospitalization,
an emergency room visit, or a visit to or from medical personnel)

67

Parents/guardians of each subject were instructed to contact the investigator immediately in case of
SAEs or IS during the study. SAEs were also ascertained by medical history at planned study visits
and contacts. Parents/guardians were informed of the signs and symptoms of IS: severe colicky
abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and fever up to 41°C. They
were also instructed to seek medical advice at the nearest hospital in case of IS symptom onset.
Procedures for grading the intensity of unsolicited AEs/SAEs, assessing causality of AEs/SAEs to
vaccination, follow-up of AEs/SAEs, and SAE reporting were the same as in Rota-023.
Occurrences of unsolicited symptoms after each Rotarix or placebo dose were coded according to
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification. Every verbatim term from
safety reports was matched with an appropriate Preferred Term (PT).
IS Case Ascertainment and Follow-up
Follow-up diagnostic procedures for IS cases were similar to that in Rota-023. The diagnosis of IS
was to have been documented by radiography, with documentation by untrasonography dependent
on available expertise. Several biological samples were collected for all IS cases, including 1) stool
samples, rectal swabs, and throat swabs for RV, enteroviruses and adenoviruses, 2) acute and
convalescent serum samples, and 3) for surgical resections, any enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes
and specimens from resected bowel or appendix for -------------------------------------------, or
------ testing. Fresh stool samples were also tested locally for enteric pathogens.
Serology Analysis
Sera were collected from a subset of 300 subjects per study country at Visit 1 (pre-Dose 1) and
Visit 3 (post-Dose 2). Anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations were measured by ELISA at GSK’s
central laboratory or a validated GSK-designated laboratory.
Sera were also collected Post-Dose 3 of routine vaccines for antibody measurements to 1) D, T, PT,
HFA, PRN, HBs, PRP, meningococcal C, and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (7 serotypes)
by -------- ELISA and 2) poliovirus (1, 2, 3) by ----------------------------- test.
Other Laboratory testing
Anti-meningococcal C bactericidal activity was performed using an in-house serum test.
Forms
1. GE diary card
2. Reactogenicity diary card
3. Electronic Case Report Form (CRF)
4. SAE Report Form
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)
An IDMC consisting of clinical experts and a biostatistician was charged with monitoring the safety
aspects of the Rotarix clinical development. The IDMC conducted unblinded reviews of each
SAE/IS case and each fatal case.
8.1.2.1.7

Statistical Considerations

Power Considerations - Primary Efficacy Objective
Assuming a true VE of 70% and an incidence rate of any RV GE of 10% in the placebo group during
the 1st efficacy period, 2260 subjects in the Rotarix group and 1130 subjects in the placebo group, the
study had 91% power to observe a LL of the VE 95% CI greater than 50%.
Power Considerations – Secondary Immunogenicity Objective
Assuming seroprotection rates of 97% for anti-diphtheria, 99% for anti-tentatus, 100% for anti-PRP,
94% for anti-HBs and 100% for antio-polio type 1,2 and 3 antibodies, and a standard deviation
between 0.28 and 0.33 for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibody concentrations, 160 Rotarix
and 80 placebo subjects provided the following:

68

-

at least 80% global power that all the 95% CIs on the decrease in seroprotection rates in the
vaccine group compared to placebo would be below 10%
at least 80% global power that the 95% CIs on the fold decrease in anti-PT, anti-FHA, and
anti-PRN GMCs in the vaccine group vs. placebo would be below 1.5

Study Cohorts
Total vaccinated cohorts (TVCs) consisted of all subjects that were administered at least one
vaccine/placebo, and underwent the following analyses:
- primary safety analysis
- secondary immunogenicity analysis for subjects with immunogenicity data (if needed)
- secondary efficacy analysis for subjects with efficacy follow-up data
The TVC for immunogenicity-reactogenicity subset included vaccinated subjects in the TVC who
had planned to provide reactogenicity data and blood samples were to be collected for
immunogenicity data. The immunogenicity-reactogenicity subset was used for the reactogenicity
analysis and secondary immunogenicity analysis.
The ATP safety (reactogenicity) cohort consisted of subjects who 1) received at least 1 dose of
vaccine/placebo, 2) did not have their randomization codes broken, and 3) did not receive a vaccine
forbidden by or not specified in the protocol. The ATP safety cohort was to be performed if needed.
The ATP efficacy cohort consisted of all subjects from the ATP safety cohort who 1) received 2
doses of vaccine/placebo, 3) entered into efficacy follow-up period (1st period, 2nd period, combined
period – had follow-up beyond 2 weeks post-Dose 2) 4) did not have their randomization codes
broken before the end of Year 1 efficacy follow-up, and 5) did not receive a vaccine forbidden by or
not specified in the protocol, and 6) did not have rotavirus other than vaccine strain in GE stool
samples collected between the Day 0 (Dose 1) and 2 weeks post-Dose 2. The ATP efficacy cohort
was used for the primary efficacy analysis, while the TVC was used for the secondary efficacy
analysis. The ATP cohort for efficacy during the 1st efficacy period was also used to calculate
efficacy during the combined period.
Criteria for the ATP immunogenicity cohort were identical to that of Rota-023. The ATP
immunogenicity cohort was used for the primary immunogenicity analysis.
Final Analyses
Final analyses for efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were performed after subjects completed
Visit 5. Access to individual treatment decode was strictly controlled until the end of the 2nd efficacy
follow-up period.
The following analyses were performed:
1. Demographics: age and height/weight (mean, range, SD per group), race and gender, summary of
feeding criteria on vaccination days, number of siblings/subject, day care attendance, by group;
distribution of enrolled subjects among study centers as a whole and by group; length of intervals
between specific time points; drop-outs at Visit 5, by reason
2. Efficacy – 1st efficacy follow-up period:
a. VE against any and severe RV GE due to wild-type RV strains
b. VE against any and severe RV GE due to wild-type G1 RV strains
c. VE against any and severe RV GE due to wild-type non-G1 RV strains
d. VE against hospitalization for RV GE due to wild-type RV strains
e. VE against any medical attention for RV GE due to wild-type RV strains
f. VE against any and severe wild-type RV GE from Dose 1 to Visit 5
g. VE against any and severe RV GE due to wild-type RV strains for subjects who completed
the 2-dose vaccination course before the RV epidemic season
h. VE against any and severe RV GE due to wild-type RV strains for subjects vaccinated
during the RV epidemic season

69

VE against any RV GE, any G1 RV GE, and any non-G1 RV GE during the 1st efficacy follow-up
period was also estimated by the Cox proportional-hazard model.
For the 2nd efficacy and combined follow-up periods, VE against severe RV GE, severe RV GE due
to G1 serotypes, severe RV GE due to non-G1 serotypes, hospitalization due to RV GE and any
medical attention for RV GE will be calculated.
The following additional analyses will be performed:
- VE by country
- VE against any RV GE during the 2nd efficacy period
- VE against severe GE
- VE from Dose 1 until 2 weeks post-Dose 2
- VE against hospitalization due to GE of any etiology
- VE against severe RV GE using alternative scoring systems other than the Vesikari system
- Assessment of risk factors of RV infection (age of child at first RV infection, breastfeeding,
number of siblings and attendance at day care)
For all VE analyses, a GE episode without a stool sample or available result was not considered as
a RV GE episode.
3. Immunogenicity (for each country and pooled countries, at each time point):
a. Seropositivity/seroprotection/seroconversion rates and 95% CI
b. GMCs/GMTs and 95% CIs, by group
The asymptotic standardized 95% CI for difference in seroconversion percentages between the
groups at Visit 3 will be computed. Also, the difference in immune responses to childhood vaccines
after Dose 2 of the primary series will be evaluated by the asymptotic standardized 2-sided 95% CI
(for difference in seropositivity and seroprotection rates between groups) and the 2-sided 95% CI
(for the ratio of GMCs or GMTs between groups)
Immunogenicity analyses excluded subjects with missing or non-evaluable measurements.
Antibody concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cutoff for the purpose of GMC calculation.
4. Safety
a. Subset of subjects- Solicited follow-up period
- Overall incidence of any AEs (solicited and unsolicited), by group, by dose, for overall
doses, by subject
- Incidence of each solicited symptom, by group, over the follow-up period, after each
dose, for all doses, by subject; same calculations for Grade 3 and vaccine-related
symptoms
- Increase in incidence of specific symptoms in Rotarix vs. placebo groups
- Summary of reactogenicity by country
b. All subjects
- Signs and symptoms coded according to MedDRA; every verbatim term matched with
an appropriate PT
- % of subjects with unsolicited symptoms within 31 days, by group, by SOC and PT;
similar tabulations for vaccine-related unsolicited symptoms
- Summary of SAEs by group
Subjects with no symptoms documented were considered as subjects without symptoms.
Interim Analyses
An interim analysis on reactogenicity and immunogenicity was performed with available data at Visit 3
(data lock point: June 20, 2005) from the Italy and Finland subsets only. The analysis presented a
descriptive summary of reactogenicity data on solicited and unsolicited symptoms, immunogenicity for

70

the study vaccine, and immunogenicity data for co-administered childhood vaccines. To maintain study
blinding for the study applicant, subjects families and investigators, the analysis was performed by the
independent data center supporting the IDMC. No study report was written, and access to the results
was strictly controlled.
Additional analyses/changes
The following additions or deletions to the final protocol and reporting/analysis plan were made:
- VE in subjects who completed 2 doses before the RV epidemic season versus those
vaccinated during the RV epidemic season not performed because 90.2% of subjects were
vaccinated during the RV epidemic season
- Interim analysis performed on TVC for immunogenicity/reactogenicity subsets in Finland and
Italy to calculate GMCs/GMTs and seropositivity/seroprotection rates for antibodies to coadministered childhood vaccine antigens post-Dose 3
- Post-hoc descriptive analysis performed to evaluate post-Dose 3 immunogenicity of coadministered childhood vaccine antigens for Center 7715 and for the German cohort
excluding Center 7715; only subjects receiving 3 doses of childhood vaccinations up to 21
days before blood sampling were included
- % of subjects with ≥ one SAE from Dose 1 summarized by group, for pooled countries
- VE on the TVC calculated for the period from Dose 1 to Visit 7

Protocol deviations – ATP efficacy cohort for 1st follow-up period
The following protocol deviations led to subject exclusion from the ATP cohort:
- 10 (Rotarix-7, placebo-3) received intercurrent vaccines forbidden in the protocol
- 1 (Rotarix-1) had randomization code broken due to IS reported on Day 8 post-Dose 2
- 9 (Rotarix-6,placebo-3) received study dose not administered per protocol
- 52 (Rotarix-31, placebo-21) were initially positive for serum anti-RV IgA antibodies at Visit 1
or serological status at Visit 1 unknown (these subjects were part of the immunogenicityreactogenicity subset)
- 35 (Rotarix-25, placebo-10) did not receive Dose 2 of Rotarix or placebo
- 3 (Rotarix-2, placebo-1) did not enter into the 1st efficacy surveillance period
- 10 (Rotarix-2, placebo-8) had non-vaccine strain RV positive GE stool samples collected
between Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2
A total of 3874 subjects were included in the ATP efficacy cohort. Of note, subjects who completed
Visit 5 outside the planned time period of mid-June to the end of July 2005 were not eliminated from
the ATP efficacy cohort.

The percentage of subjects (pooled across all countries) who were vaccinated during the RV
season was similar between groups (Rotarix-90.6%, placebo -90.2%). The percentage between
groups was comparable for each country.
Study demographics – TVC (N=3994)
The median ages at Dose 1 (12 weeks), Dose 2 (20 weeks), Visit 5 (10 months) and Visit 7 (22
months) were the same between groups. Most of the subjects in either group were
White/Caucasian. The female-to-male ratios were comparable between groups. Height, weight, and
BMI measurements were also the same or very similar between groups. Demographic data were
also comparable between groups for each country, except for some female-to-male ratio
imbalances between groups in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. The number of siblings and
percentages of subjects who did not attend day care at Visits 1 through 5 (>90%) and at Visit 7
(>61%) were similar between groups.

The percentages of subjects who received 3 doses of childhood vaccinations from Visit 1 to 21 days
before post-Dose 3 blood sampling at Visit 3 (Visit 4 for Spain) was 81.3% (Infanrix Hexa) for the
Czech Republic, 98.4% (2 doses of Infanrix Hexa)/100% (1 dose of Infanrix Polio Hib) and 99.2%
(Prevnar) for France, 74.9% (Infanrix Hexa) and 74.1% (Prevnar) for Germany, and 100% (Infanrix

vaccinations from Visit 1 to 21 days before post-Dose 3 blood sampling at Visit 5/6 was 100%
(Infanrix Hexa) for both Finland and Italy.
Reviewer Note: Data for 3 doses of routine vaccinations for Spain, Finland, and Italy were not
included in the analysis databases.
A minimum of 21 days between Dose 2 or Dose 3 of routine vaccination and post-vaccination blood
sampling was needed to elicit adequate immune responses. At Visit 3 or Visit 4 (Spain), the median
number of days between Dose 3 and post-vaccination blood sampling was the same or similar for all
countries: Czech Republic (Rotarix-28, placebo-29), France (both groups-32), Germany (Rotarix-31,
placebo-32), and Spain (both groups-35). At Visit 3, the median number of days between Dose 2 and
post-vaccination blood sampling was the same or similar for all countries: Finland (Rotarix-35, placebo36), Italy (Rotarix-36, placebo-37), and Spain (Rotarix-54, placebo-54). At Visit 5/6, the median number
of days between Dose 3 and post-vaccination blood sampling was similar for Finland (Rotarix-37,
placebo-38) and Italy (Rotarix-35.5, placebo-36).

Protocol deviations – ATP efficacy cohort for 2nd follow-up period
The following is a summary of protocol deviations that led to subject exclusion in the ATP cohort:
- 26 (Rotarix-18, placebo-8) did not enter into the 2nd efficacy surveillance period
A total of 3848 subjects were included in the ATP efficacy cohort for the 2nd follow-up period.
Subjects who completed Visit 7 outside the planned time period of mid-June to end-July 2006 were
not eliminated from the ATP efficacy cohort.
Study demographics – ATP efficacy cohort during 2nd period (N=3848)
Demographic characteristics are included in the table below. The median ages at Dose 1 (12
weeks), Dose 2 (20 weeks), and Visit 5 (11 months), and Visit 7 (22 months) were the same
between groups. Most of the subjects in either group were White/Caucasian. The female-to-male
ratios were comparable between groups. Median height, weight, and BMI measurements were also
the same between groups.

Clinical characteristics of RV GE episodes – Year 1
The duration of looser than normal stools and vomiting were shorter in the Rotarix group compared
to the placebo group. The frequencies of fever ≥ 39.0°C, dehydration, and hospitalization were also
less in the Rotarix group compared to placebo.
Vaccine efficacy against any RV GE – Year 1 (Primary endpoint)
VE of Rotarix against any wild-type RV GE during the 1st efficacy follow-up period was 87.1%. The
primary efficacy objective was reached because the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 50%
(refer to section 8.1.2.1.7 of this report on power considerations). VE was also 87.4% (95%CI: 80.391.9%) using the Cox proportional-hazard model.

VE against any RV GE by main RV serotypes – Year 1 (Secondary endpoint)
VE against any RV GE by serotype is presented below. VE against any G1 RV GE was 95.6%; VE using
Cox proportional hazard model was also significant (95.6%: 95%CI 87.9-98.4). VE against G3, G4, G9,
and all non-G1 types pooled together reached statistical significance. However, the lower level of the
95% CI for VE against G3 was low (9.5%). VE against non-G1 types using Cox proportional hazard
model was also significant (79.5%: 95%CI 65.5-87.8). Although fewer G2 episodes occurred in the
Rotarix group, VE did not reach statistical significance.

VE against hospitalized RV GE – Year 1 (Secondary endpoint)
No Rotarix recipient was hospitalized for RV GE compared to 12 placebo recipients. VE was
100.0% (95% CI: 81.8-100%).
VE against RV GE requiring medical attention – Year 1 (Secondary endpoint)
Medical attention (defined as medical provider contact, advice, or visit; emergency room contact or visit
or hospitalization) occurred significantly less in Rotarix than placebo recipients (10 vs 62, or 0.4% vs
4.8%, respectively). VE was 91.8% (95% CI: 84.0-96.3%).
VE against all cause GE – Year 1 (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against GE of any etiology was 16.5% (95% CI: 4.2-27.2%).
VE against all cause severe GE – Year 1 (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against severe GE of any etiology was 52.3% (95% CI: 38.0-63.3%).
VE against all cause GE requiring hospitalization – Year 1 (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against GE of any etiology requiring hospitalization was 74.7% (95% CI: 45.5-88.9%).
VE against any RV GE by serum IgA status at Visit 3 – Year 1 (Exploratory endpoint)
Among subjects who were seropositive for anti-RV IgA at Visit 3, 2 (0.3%) Rotarix recipients versus 2
(6.5%) placebo recipients reported any RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 5; VE was 95.6%

80

(95% CI: 39.8-99.7%). The applicant concluded that it was difficult to correlate seroconversion rate and
VE because immunogenicity was evaluated in only a subset of subjects.
VE against any RV GE and severe RV GE by feeding criteria – Year 1 (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against any RV GE among subjects that breastfed at the time of at least one dose was similar to
VE among subjects not breastfed at any of the doses (86.0%, 95% CI: 76-91.9% vs. 90.8%, 95%
CI: 72.5-97.7%, respectively). VE against severe RV GE for the 2 feeding strata were also similar
and statistically significant (95.7% vs. 96.2%, respectively).
VE against severe RV GE using the Clark scale – Year 1 (Exploratory endpoint)
Compared to the Vesikari scale, the Clark scale classified less severe RV GE episodes in both
treatment groups (Rotarix-2, placebo-15). However, VEClark was 93.3% (95% CI: 71.0-99.3%), similar
to VEVesikari (95.8%). VE against G1 (93.7%; 95% CI: 52.8-99.9%), G9 (91.6%; 95% CI: 30.5-99.8),
and all non-G1 types pooled together (92.8; 95% CI: 43.7-99.8) reached statistical significance.
VE against any RV GE and severe RV GE, by country – Year 1 (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against any RV GE ranged from 78.9% to 100% in the Czech Republic, Finland, France, and
Spain. However, only the VE estimate for Finland (88.6%; 81.0-93.4%) reached statistical significance
due to a larger study population than in the other countries. VE could not be calculated for Germany
and Italy due to one and zero RV GE episodes occurring, respectively.
Similarly, VEVesikari and VEClark against severe RV GE reached statistical significance in Finland only
(96.4%; 90.2-99.1% and 92.8; 68.6-99.2, respectively).
Year 1 Efficacy (Dose 1 to Visit 5) – TVC
Summary of RV GE episodes with vaccine strains
G1P8 vaccine strain was isolated from stools of 5 GE episodes occurring from Dose 1 up to 2
weeks post-Dose 2. One of the 5 episodes was reported as a mixed infection with G9P8 wild type
RV; this wild-type RV was included in the efficacy analysis from Dose 1 up to 2 weeks post-Dose 2.
Summary of reported RV GE episodes
A total of 130 subjects in the TVC reported one episode of any RV GE from Dose 1 to Visit 5; 26
(1.0%) occurred in Rotarix recipients and 104 (7.7%) occurred in placebo recipients. No subject in
either group had more than one RV GE episode. Stool results were not available for 10.0% of
Rotarix and 11.2% of placebo recipients with GE episodes.
Severe RV GE was reported in 69 subjects (Rotarix-5, placebo-64) using the Vesikari scale and 17
subjects (Rotarix-2, placebo-15) using the Clark scale.
VE against any RV GE – Dose 1 to Visit 5 (Secondary endpoint)
The median duration of follow-up during this interval was approximately 8.4 months in the Rotarix
group and 8.5 months in the placebo group. VE against any RV GE was 87.3% (95% CI: 80.392.0%), similar to the VE estimate for the primary endpoint in the ATP cohort (87.1%).
Similar to the ATP cohort, VE against wild-type G1, G3, G4, G9, and pooled non-G1 types reached
statistical significance (95.8%, 85.4%, 89.1%, 77.7%, and 80.3%, respectively).
VE reached statistical significance in Finland (88.5%; 81.1-93.3%) and Spain (91.6%; 30.4-99.8%).
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to Visit 5 (Secondary endpoint)
VEVesikari against severe RV GE was 96.0% (95% CI: 90.2-98.8%), similar to the VE estimate for the
primary endpoint in the ATP cohort (95.8%). Statistical significance was only reached in Finland
(VE = 96.4%; 90.4-99.1%). VE against wild-type G1, G3, G4, G9, and pooled non-G1 types
reached statistical significance (96.5%, 100%, 100%, 95.1%, and 95.8%, respectively). VEClark was
93.2% (70.8-99.2%).

81

VE against all cause GE episodes – Dose 1 to Visit 5 (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against GE episodes of any etiology was 14.6% (3.6-24.3%). VE against severe GE episodes of
any etiology was 52.4% (39.0-62.8%).
VE against hospitalized RV GE episodes – Dose 1 to Visit 5 (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against hospitalized RV GE was 100% (81.7-100%).
VE against any RV GE episodes requiring medical attention – Dose 1 to Visit 5 (Exploratory)
VE was 92.0% (84.8-96.2%).
Year 1 Efficacy (Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2) – TVC
Summary of reported RV GE episodes
Two Rotarix and 8 placebo recipients reported an episode of RV GE during this interval. No subject in
either group had more than one RV GE episode. Severe RV GE was reported in 3 placebo subjects
only using the Vesikari scale and 0 subjects using the Clark scale. Stool results were unavailable for
13.9% of Rotarix and 13.3% of placebo recipients with GE episodes.
VE against any RV GE – Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2 (Exploratory endpoint)
The median duration of follow-up during this interval was 2.5 months in both groups.
VE was 87.3% (46.2-98.7%).
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2 (Exploratory endpoint)
VEVesikari against severe RV GE was 100% (-23.3-100%).
Year 1 Efficacy (Dose 1 to pre-Dose 2) – TVC
Summary of reported RV GE episodes
One Rotarix and 5 placebo recipients reported an episode of RV GE during this interval. No subject
had more than one RV GE episode. Severe RV GE was reported in 3 subjects (Rotarix-0, placebo3) using the Vesikari scale and 0 subjects using the Clark scale. Stool results were not available for
14.7% of Rotarix and 14.9% of placebo recipients with GE episodes.
VE against any RV GE – Dose 1 to pre-Dose 2 (Exploratory endpoint not mentioned in
protocol or as an additional analysis)
The median duration of follow-up was 2 months for both groups. VE was 89.8 (8.9-99.8%).
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to pre-Dose 2 (Exploratory endpoint not mentioned in
protocol or as an additional analysis)
VEVesikari against severe RV GE was 100% (-23.3-100%).
Year 1 Immunogenicity – ATP immunogenicity cohort
Anti-RV IgA response
Anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs at pre-Dose 1, Visit 3 (1-2 months post-Dose 2), and
Visit 5 (3 months post-Dose 2, Spain only) are presented below. Visit 3 Post-Dose 2 seroconversion
rates and GMCs were significantly greater in the Rotarix group compared to placebo. The
difference in Visit 3 seroconversion rates between Rotarix and placebo groups was 79.86% (95%
CI: 76.19-82.96%). Visit 3 rates ranged from 82.1% in Germany to 94.6% in Finland.

Visit 3 seroconversion rates and GMCs were similar by feeding category. Among subjects who
were breastfed at one or more doses, seroconversion rates [GMCs ] were 85.5% [185.8] for Rotarix
recipients compared to 5.3% [<20] for placebo recipients. Among non-breastfed subjects,
serconversion rates were 89.2% [231.5] and 11.1% [<20] in Rotarix and placebo recipients,
respectively.

Anti-meningococcal serum bactericidal activity (SBA)-MenC response (Spain) – Visit 4
One-hundred percent of subjects in both groups achieved an SBA-MenC titer ≥ 1:8 at 1 month postDose 3 of Meningitec. For a titer ≥ 1:128, the seropositivity rates in both groups remained similar
(Rotarix-98.4%, placebo-100%); the difference in rates between groups at either titer was not
statistically significant. The 95% CIs of GMTs for each group were overlapping. GMC ratios
between groups were also not statistically significant.

Anti-pneumococcal antibody response to serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 18C, 19F, 23F (France, Germany) –
Visit 3
In France, 100% of subjects in both groups achieved anti-pneumococcal antibody titer ≥ 0.05μg/ml
for serotypes 4, 9V, 14, and 19F. Seropositivity rates for 6B, 18C, and 23F were similar between
groups with overlapping 95% CIs. For a titer ≥ 0.2μg/ml, seropositivity rates were 100% for
serotypes 4, 9V, and 14, with rates for the other serotypes being similar between groups. GMCs
were also comparable between groups for all serotypes.

In Germany, 100% of subjects in both groups achieved anti-pneumococcal antibody titer ≥
0.05μg/ml for serotypes 4, 9V, 14, 18 and 19F. Seropositivity rates for 6B and 23F were similar
between groups with overlapping 95% CIs. For a titer ≥ 0.2μg/ml, seropositivity rates were 100% in
both groups for serotypes 4 and 19F, with rates for the other serotypes being similar between
groups. GMCs were also comparable between groups for all serotypes.
For all serotypes, the difference in rates between groups at either titer, as well as the GMC ratio
between the groups, were not statistically significant for any country.

Anti-polio antibody responses to types 1, 2, 3 - Visit 3, Visit 4 (Spain only)
Seroprotection rates against all 3 poliovirus types were the same or similar between groups in all
countries. GMTs were comparable between groups in all countries with overlapping 95% CIs. For
each type, the difference in rates between groups was not statistically significant for any country,
with the exception of the Czech Republic, where the rate difference (placebo-Rotarix) was -3.39%
(95% CI: -11.54, -0.32), therefore favoring the Rotarix group. GMC ratios between the groups were
not statistically significant for any country for any type.

Post-Dose 3 (Visit 3) immunogenicity of routine vaccinations – Germany (Post-hoc analysis)
Post-hoc immunogenicity analysis was conducted in Germany to determine whether one study
center, Center 7715, may have contributed to the overall lower immunogenicity response trends. A
separate analysis was conducted on all German subjects excluding those from Center 7715. Only
subjects who received 3 doses of childhood vaccinations up to 21 days before blood sampling were
included in the analyses.
For subjects enrolled at Center 7715, immune responses to diphtheria, tetanus, PT, FHA, PRN,
HBs, poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, and PRP was much lower in both groups than in the overall data
presented above. In contrast, immune responses were much higher in both groups among subjects
excluding those from Center 7715. Seroprotection rates for diphtheria and tetanus, as well as
seropositivity rates for PT, FHA, and PRN, were 100% for both groups. Seroprotection rate for HBs
(Rotarix-94.5%, placebo-100%), all polio types (Rotarix-100%, placebo-97.3 to 100%), and PRP (≥
0.15μg/ml titer: Rotarix – 98.9%, placebo-92.3%; ≥ 1.0 μg/ml titer: Rotarix-76.3%, placebo-73.1%)
were also high and comparable to estimates from other countries.
Post-Dose 2 (Visit 3) immunogenicity of routine vaccinations – Finland, Italy, Spain
In each country, seroprotection/seropositivity rates and GMCs/GMTs to diphtheria, tetanus, PT,
FHA, PRN, HBs, poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, PRP, and SBA-MenC/PSC (Spain only) were similar
between groups. Differences in rates and GMC or GMT ratios between groups for each vaccine
antigen were not statistically significant, with the following exceptions: 1) difference in
seroprotection rates against PRP (≥ 0.15μg/ml titer) in Finland favoring the Rotarix group 2) GMC
ratios against polio type 3 in Finland and Spain, both favoring the Rotarix group

Vaccine efficacy against severe RV GE – Year 2 (Secondary endpoint)
Nineteen (0.7%) Rotarix recipients reported severe RV GE compared to 67 (5.2%) placebo
recipients. VE was 85.6% (95% CI: 75.8-91.9%).
VE against severe RV GE by main RV serotypes – Year 2 (Secondary endpoint)
VE against severe G1 RV GE was 96.5%. VE against G2, G9, and all non-G1 types pooled together
reached statistical significance. However, the lower level of the 95% CI for VE against G2 was low
(9.4%) compared to the other categories. Although the p-value was 0.047 for VE against G4, the
lower level of the 95% CI was -28.0%. Although there were less G3 infections in Rotarix compared to
placebo recipients, VE did not reach statistical significance.

VE against GE of any etiology requiring hospitalization was 64.9% (95% CI: 33.5-81.9%).
VE against severe RV GE using the Clark scale – Year 2 (Exploratory endpoint)
Compared to the Vesikari scale, the Clark scale classified less severe RV GE episodes in both
treatment groups (Rotarix-1, Placebo-15). VEClark was 96.6% (95% CI: 78.0-99.9%), compared to
VEVesikari of 85.6%.
VE against G1 (100.0%; 95% CI: 57.0-100%), G9 (92.8%; 95% CI: 43.7-99.8), and all non-G1 types
pooled together (94.4%; 95% CI: 59.4-99.9%) reached statistical significance.
VE against any RV GE and severe RV GE, by country – Year 2 (Exploratory)
VE against any RV GE ranged from -5.7 to 75.1% in the Czech Republic, Finland, France,
Germany and Spain. However, only the VE estimates for Finland (73.7%; 95% CI: 62.6-81.7%) and
Spain (66.2; 95% CI: 1.8-89.1%) reached statistical significance due to a larger study population
than in the other countries. VE could not be calculated for Italy due to 0 RV GE episodes occurring.
Similarly, VEVesikari against severe RV GE reached statistical significance in Finland and Spain only.
VEVesikari was 85.7% (95% CI: 75.2-92.2%) for Finland and 83.9% (95% CI: 10.1-98.4%) for Spain.
VEClark was 95.8% (95% CI: 71.6-99.9%) for Finland and 100.0% (95% CI: -16.7-100.0%) for Spain.

VE against any and severe RV GE by serum IgA status at Visit 3 – Combined period
(Exploratory endpoint)
Among subjects who were negative for anti-RV IgA at Visit 3, 4 (3.6%) Rotarix recipients versus 43
(10.4%) placebo recipients reported any RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 7; VE was
64.9% (95% CI: 3.4-90.9%). VE against severe RV GE was 100.0% (95% CI: 19.2-100.0%) among
seronegative subjects. Among subjects who were seropositive at Visit 3, VE was 65.1% although
not statistically significant; VE against severe RV GE could not be calculated. The applicant
concluded that it was difficult to correlate seroconversion rate and VE because immunogenicity was
evaluated in only a subset of subjects.
VE against severe RV GE by feeding criteria – Combined period (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against any RV GE among subjects that breastfed at the time of at least one dose was 76.2%
(95% CI: 68.7-82.1%). VE among subjects not breastfed at any of the doses was 89.8% (95% CI:
77.6-95.9%). VE against severe RV GE among subjects that breastfed at the time of at least one
dose was 88.4% (95% CI: 81.6-93.0%). VE among subjects not breastfed at any of the doses was
98.1% (95% CI: 88.2-100%).
VE against severe RV GE using the Clark scale – Combined period (Exploratory endpoint)
Compared to the Vesikari scale, the Clark scale classified less severe RV GE episodes in both
treatment groups (Rotarix-3, Placebo-30). However, VEClark was 94.9% (95% CI: 83.7-99.0%),
similar to VEVesikari (90.4%).
VE against G1 (96.4%; 95% CI: 76.2-99.9%), G9 (92.2%; 95% CI: 65.6-99.1), and all non-G1 types
pooled together (93.7%; 95% CI: 73.1-99.3%) reached statistical significance.
VE against any and severe RV GE, by country – Combined period (Exploratory endpoint)
VE against any RV GE ranged from -57.5 to 80.6% in the Czech Republic, Finland, France,
Germany and Spain. However, only the VE estimates for Finland (80.6%; 95% CI: 74.3-85.6%) and
Spain (69.3; 95% CI: 13.3-89.9%) reached statistical significance due to a larger study population
than in the other countries. VE could not be calculated for Italy due to 0 RV GE episodes occurring.
Similarly, VEVesikari against severe RV GE reached statistical significance in Finland and Spain only.
VEVesikari was 90.9% (95% CI: 85.4-94.5%) for Finland and 83.9% (95% CI: 10.1-98.4%) for Spain.
VEClark was 94.2% (95% CI: 81.0-98.9%) for Finland and 100.0% (95% CI: -16.7-100.0%) for Spain.
Dose 1 to Visit 7 Efficacy – TVC
Summary of reported any RV GE and severe RV GE episodes – Dose 1 to Visit 7
The median duration of follow-up during this interval was approximately 20 months in each group.
Among Rotarix and placebo recipients, wild-type RV was detected in 87 and 215 GE episodes,
respectively; no subject in either group had more than one RV GE episode during the 1st efficacy

countries. For both antigens, the differences in rates between groups, as well as the GMC ratio
between the groups, were not statistically significant at Visit 5/6 for either country.

Seroprotection rates against poliovirus types 1 and 2 were 100% for both groups at both time points
in Italy, while rates were 100% for poliovirus type 3 for both groups at Visit 5/6. Seroprotection rates
against all 3 types were similar between groups at both time points in Finland; rates were 100%
against types 1 and 2 for both groups at Visit 5/6, while rates were 100% and 98% for the Rotarix
and placebo groups, respectively, against type 3 at Visit 5/6. GMTs were also similar between
groups at both time points in both countries, except that Visit 5/6 anti-Polio 2 titers tended to be
higher in the Rotarix group compared to placebo in Finland. For each type, the differences in rates
between groups, as well as the GMT ratio between the groups, were not statistically significant at
Visit 5/6 for either country, except that the anti-Polio 2 placebo/Rotarix GMC ratio in Finland was

Post-Dose 2 (Visit 4) and Post-Dose 3 (Visit 5/6) immunogenicity of routine vaccinations –
Finland, Italy
Immunogenicity results obtained in the TVC for immunogenicity-reactogenicity subset were
generally consistent with those obtained from the ATP immunogenicity cohort.
Visit 5/6 anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus seroprotection rates were >99.4% in both groups in either
country, with similar GMCs to both antigens between groups.
Visit 5/6 anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN seropositivity rates were 100% in both groups in either
country, with GMCs also being comparable between groups for each antigen.
Anti-HBs seroprotection rates were 100% in the Rotarix group in either country. GMCs were
comparable between groups.

The percentages of subjects who reported at least one Grade 3 solicited or unsolicited symptom after
Dose 1 and after Dose 2, as well as the percentages who reported at least one Grade 3 symptom
among those who received at least one study dose, were less in the Rotarix group compared to
placebo. 95% CIs for the point estimates were overlapping between groups. The incidence of AEs in
either group did not increase with subsequent doses.

Solicited general AEs – Days 0-7 post-dose
The incidence of total AEs, Grade 3 AEs, and vaccine-related AEs for each symptom after each
dose was similar between Rotarix and placebo group. Post-Dose 1 incidence for each symptom
appeared similar to post-Dose 2 incidence, with the exception of total fever, which was 8.8% and
10.6% higher post-Dose 2 in Rotarix and placebo recipients, respectively. Smaller increases in
Grade 3 and vaccine-related fever post-Dose 2 were also observed in both groups. Most of the
post-vaccination fever AEs were Grade 1 and 2, and thought to be attributed by co-administered
childhood vaccines.
Irritability/fussiness was the most common AE in both groups after each dose, followed by
cough/runny nose. Diarrhea AEs were uncommon in both groups after each dose. Grade 3 AEs
were uncommon for each symptom.

There appeared to be no significant and isolated peak in the percentage of subjects with diarrhea or
vomiting during Day 0 to Day 7 after each dose. Fever occurred most frequently at Day 0 and Day 1
in both groups after each dose.
There were no significant differences in rates of total, Grade 3, or vaccine-related solicited AEs
between groups for any of the symptoms after any dose (table below). Rates of AEs for each
symptom after each dose were also similar between groups in each country. Distribution of AEs for
each country appeared similar to the overall distribution for all countries pooled together.
In the Rotarix group, ≥ 10% of subjects reported any cough/runny nose, fever, irritability/fussiness,
loss of appetite, and vomiting, while 4.2% reported any diarrhea.
Grade 3 symptoms reported in ≥ 1% and <10 % of Rotarix subjects were cougn/runny nose (1.8%),
diarrhea (1.0%), irritability/fussiness (4.4%), loss of appetite (1.0%), and vomiting (2.0%).

Year 1 Safety – TVC
Unsolicited AEs – Days 0-30 post-dose
The percentages of subjects who had at least one AE of any kind, one Grade 3 AE, and one
vaccine-related AE were similar between groups (table below). Among unsolicited AEs of any kind,
significant increase in Rotarix compared to placebo was observed for the PT Flatulence (risk
difference= 1.33%) and PT Irritability (risk difference= 3.99%). These PTs were not statistically
significant between groups among Grade 3 AEs, and only PT Irritability (3.19%) was statistically
significant between groups among vaccine-related AEs. After further review of cases in these 2
PTs, the applicant concluded that there was no evidence of clinically relevant findings and that the
imbalance was possibly a chance finding.
AE PTs of any intensity reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects were conjunctivitis (3.2%), upper
abdominal pain (1.4%), constipation (1.9%), flatulence (3.8%), gastrointestinal disorder (2.9%),
regurgitation of food (1.3%), teething (2.1%), vomiting (1.8%), fatigue (1.7%), injection site pain
(4.0%), irritability (21%), pyrexia (23.1%), bronchiolitis (1.2%), bronchitis (1.5%), ear infection
(1.0%), influenza (1.4%), nasopharyngitis (1.1%), otitis media (4.8%), respiratory tract infection
(2.3%), rhinitis (11.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (7.3%), crying (8.3%), cough (5.1%), nasal
congestion (1.2%), atopic dermatitis (1.2%), eczema (1.2%), rash (1.2%),

AEs reported after IM administration of study dose
One subject received Dose 1 of placebo IM by error. The subject experienced fever (Tmax=38.5°C on
Day 0), irritability (grade 1 on Day 0), and loss of appetite (grade 1 on Day 0). No injection site
reactions were reported. The child was subsequently asymptomatic and event was considered
resolved after 3 days; Dose 2 was administered Dose 2 orally. The treatment code for this subject
was not broken.
Reviewer Note: Reviewer noted that Dose 1 was categorized as “administered according to
protocol” and given orally (“OR”) for this subject in the analysis database.
Reviewer Note: The reviewer also explored rates of bronchitis in each group. After PTs Bronchitis
and Bronchitis acute were combined, no imbalances were observed within 31 days post-vaccination
(Rotarix- 35 [1.3%], placebo - 18 [1.3%]) or within 43 days post-vaccination (Rotarix – 38 [1.4%],
placebo – 20 [1.5%]).
Reviewer Note: The reviewer also explored rates of non-SAE pneumonia in each group. After PTs
Pneumonia and Bronchopneumonia were combined, an imbalance not favoring the Rotarix group
was not observed within 31 days post-vaccination (Rotarix- 3 [0.11%], placebo - 3 [0.22%]) or within
43 days post-vaccination (Rotarix – 3 [0.11%], placebo – 4 [0.30%]).
SAEs – Dose 1 to Visit 5
During this interval, there were significantly less Rotarix than placebo recipients who reported at
least one SAE. None of the 268 SAEs were judged to be related to vaccination. The applicant did
not provide distributions of SAEs by SOC or PT categories for this interval.

IS=intussusception
(Source: Study Report Body Rota-036Year 1, pg 165)

Reviewer Note: The reviewer did not observe noticeable differences for each PT between groups.
In addition, the reviewer calculated the number of subjects who reported at least one SAE from Day
0-30 post-dose as follows: Rotarix – 46 (17.4%), placebo – 28 (20.8%). Also, one Rotarix recipient
reported a non-IS SAE that was categorized as causally related to vaccination (PT Gastroenteritis,
7 days post-Dose 1). No SAE PT was reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects.
One case of intussusception (IS) was reported. This subject, a 4 month-old male from the Czech
Republic who developed abdominal pain and vomiting 8 days post-Dose 2 of Rotarix, was
diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound, and underwent surgical correction without intestinal resection.
Rectal swabs were negative for enteric pathogens. The event resolved after 7 days. The
investigator considered this event to have possibly been related to vaccination. The treatment code
for this subject was broken.
Deaths – Dose 1 to Visit 5
No deaths were reported during this interval.
SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out at Visit 5
Four subjects (all placebo recipients) dropped out of the study due to SAEs. Three of the 4 dropped
out due to convulsion-related AEs (PTs Convulsion, Epilepsy, and Infantile spasms), while the
fourth dropped out due to PT Lissencephaly. All SAEs were considered to be unrelated to
vaccination.
Seven Rotarix recipients and 2 placebo recipients dropped out due to non-SAEs. Among the
Rotarix recipients, 2 dropped out due to PT Bronchospasm (34 and 61 days post-dose), 1 due to

109

PT Constipation (14 days post-dose),1 due to PT Gastroenteritis (4 days post-dose), 1 due to PT
Hypersensitivity (Day 0), 1 due to PT Irritability (2 days post-dose), and 1 due to PT Hematochezia
(8 days post-Dose). The 2 placebo recipients dropped out due to PT Motor dysfunction (41 days
post-dose) and PT Gastrointestinal disorder (4 days post-dose). Five of the 9 non-SAEs leading to
drop-out were assessed as related to vaccination (Rotarix-4: Bronchospasm, Gastroenteritis,
Hypersensitivity, Hematochezia, Irritability; placebo-1: Gastrointestinal disorder).
Follow-up safety (Dose 1 to Visit 7) – TVC, Year 2 efficacy period
SAEs – Dose 1 to Visit 7
During this interval, the percentage of Rotarix recipients who reported at least one SAE was less
than that for placebo recipients. SAE PTs reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects were bronchiolitis
(1.0%) and chronic bronchiolitis (1.6%),

Three cases of IS occurred during this interval. Of these, one was already described previously in
the Year 1 Safety – TVC SAEs- Dose 1 to Visit 5 section. The remaining two cases occurred after
Visit 5 and were assessed as not causally related to vaccination. One case, a 10 month-old female,
developed vomiting 7 months post-Dose 2 of Rotarix. An abdominal ultrasound was suggestive for
intestinal invagination that was resolved by enema. A stool sample was RV positive. The subject
was discharged from the hospital after one day.
The second case, a 12 month-old female, developed diarrhea 9 months post-Dose 2 of placebo,
followed by abdominal pain, vomiting, irritability and lethargy. Abdominal ultrasound showed IS
which spontaneously resolved during the ultrasound. Stool samples were negative for enteric
pathogens. The subject was discharged from the hospital after two days.
SAEs in the MedDRA SOC Infections and infestations, were reported significantly less in the
Rotarix group compared to the placebo group. The observed imbalance in this SOC was primarily
driven by PTs Gastroenteritis and Gastroenteritis rotavirus, which were also reported significantly
less in the Rotarix group than the placebo group, therefore reflecting the efficacy of Rotarix in
preventing GE episodes.
PTs Head injury and Testicular torsion were also reported significantly less in the Rotarix group
compared to placebo. These imbalances were judged to be likely a chance finding and not clinically
relevant.
The PT Pneumonia was reported significantly more in the Rotarix group compared to the placebo
group (24 vs 4, p=0.029). Of the 28 cases, 19 (Rotarix-17, placebo-2) were reported after Visit 5.
Only one of the cases was reported within 30 days after vaccination (Rotarix group, 29 days postDose 2), and a significant imbalance between groups for PT Pneumonia as an unsolicited AE from
Day 0 to Day 30 after any study dose was not observed. Upon further review of cases individually,
the applicant determined that no clinically relevant finding were evident, therefore concluding that
the potential imbalance was possibly due to chance.
Reviewer Note: Based on the data provided by the applicant, the reviewer noted that among the 28
cases of PT Pneumonia, 3 (Rotarix-3, placebo-0) occurred within 42 days post-vaccination. When
the reviewer combined pneumonia-related PTs (Pneumonia, Bronchopneumonia, Lobar
pneumonia, Pneumonia viral), an imbalance was still seen from Dose 1 to Visit 7 (Rotarix – 31,
placebo – 7), within 31 days post-vaccination (Rotarix – 2, placebo – 0) and within 43 days postvaccination (Rotarix – 5, placebo – 0).

Reviewer Note: The reviewer also explored rates of SAE bronchitis in each group. After PTs
Bronchitis and Bronchitis acute were combined, an imbalance not favoring the Rotarix group was
not observed within 31 days post-vaccination (Rotarix- 1 [0.04%], placebo - 2 [0.15%]) or within 43
days post-vaccination (Rotarix – 4 [0.15%], placebo – 3 [0.22%]).
Reviewer Note: The reviewer also explored rates of convulsion-related SAEs in each group. After
PTs Convulsion, Epilepsy, Infantile spasms, Myoclonus, and Partial seizures were combined, an
imbalance not favoring the Rotarix group was not observed within 31 or 43 days post-vaccination
(Rotarix- 1 [0.04%], placebo - 1 [0.07%]).
Deaths – Dose 1 to Visit 7
No deaths were reported during this interval.
SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out at Visit 7
Five subjects (Rotarix-1, placebo-4) withdrew due to SAEs. The four placebo subjects were
previously described in the Year 1 Safety – TVC SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out
at Visit 5 section. The remaining one Rotarix recipient withdrew due to PT Primitive
neuroectodermal tumour which was assessed as not related to vaccination.
Ten subjects (Rotarix-7, placebo-3) dropped out due to non-SAEs. Nine of the subjects (Rotarix-7,
placebo-2) were previously described in the Year 1 Safety – TVC SAEs and non-serious AEs
leading to drop-out at Visit 5 section. The remaining one placebo recipient withdrew due to PT
Varicella which was assessed as not related to vaccination.
Individual report forms reviewed
Individual International Event Report (i.e. SAE) report forms were reviewed for all IS cases.

Comments & Conclusions

In Rota-036, two doses of Rotarix at a potency of 106.5 CCID50 per dose, administered to children 6
to 14 weeks of age at 1-month or 2-month intervals, were efficacious (87.1%) against any RV GE
during the period from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until the end of the 1st RV epidemic season (1st efficacy
follow-up period). Rotarix was also efficacious against severe RV GE during this period high using
either the Vesikari scale (95.8%) or Clark scale (93.3%). Furthermore, VE against RV GE leading to
hospitalization or any medical attention during this interval was 100% and 91.8%, respectively.
During the period from after Dose 1 to the end of the 1st RV epidemic season, efficacy was
demonstrated against any RV GE and severe RV GE at 87.3% and 96.0%, respectively.
Statistically significant VE was observed against any wild-type G1 (95.6%), G3 (89.9%), G4
(88.3%), and G9 (75.6%) RV GE during the 1st efficacy follow-up period; however, the lower limit of
the 95% CI for G3 was 9.5%. When all non-G1 types were pooled together, VE was over 79.3%.
Statistically significant VE was also observed against severe wild-type G1 (96.4%), G3 (100%), G4
(100%), and G9 (94.7%) RV GE during the 1st efficacy follow-up period. However, the lower limit of
the 95% CI for the G3 estimate was 44.8%. When all non-G1 types were pooled together, VE was
95.4%. Efficacy was >80% from Dose 1 to 1 year of age and was 79% during Year 2 of follow-up.
During the period from after Visit 5 (the end of the 1st RV epidemic season) until the end of the 2nd
RV epidemic season (2nd efficacy follow-up period), Rotarix was efficacious against severe RV GE
(85.6%), severe RV GE due to G1 (96.5%) and non-G1 (G2, G4, G9) strains (≥ 77% each, although
the lower limits of the 95% CI for G2 and G4 were 9.4% and -28.0%, respectively), RV GE leading
to hospitalization (92.2%), and RV GE requiring medical attention (76.2%). VE was also efficacious
against any RV GE (71.9%), and any wild-type G1 (83.5%) and G9 (71.2%) RV GE.
During the period from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until the end of the 2nd RV epidemic season (combined
follow-up period), Rotarix was efficacious against severe RV GE (90.4%), severe RV GE due to G1
(96.4%) and non-G1 (G2, G3, G4, G9) strains (≥ 85% each, although the lower limit of the 95% CI for

111

G2 was 24.0%), RV GE leading to hospitalization (96%), and RV GE requiring medical attention
(83.8%). VE was also demonstrated against any RV GE (78.9%) and any wild-type G1 (89.8%). VE
was ≥ 58.3% each against RV GE due to G2, G3, G4, and G9 serotypes, although the 95% CIs for G2
and G3 were 10.1% and 41.0%, respectively.
Analyses of immune responses to routine childhood vaccinations demonstrated that there were no
significant differences between treatment groups in seroprotection rates, seropositivity rates, or
GMC/GMT to any of the vaccine antigens that did not favor the Rotarix group. Although there
appeared to be no impact of Rotarix on the immune responses to routine co-administered vaccine
antigens at different time points, clinical limits for non-inferiority of Rotarix compared to placebo
were not pre-defined for this study.
An increased risk in IS was not seen within 31 days after any dose nor throughout the rest of the
study; a total of only 3 cases (Rotarix-2, placebo-1) were reported. Overall rates of subjects who
experienced a solicited or unsolicited AE from Day 0 to Day 7 post-dose were similar between
treatment groups. Imbalances in rates of solicited AEs between groups were also not observed.
Among the unsolicited AEs reported from Day 0 to 30 post-dose, flatulence and irritability were
reported significantly more in the Rotarix group, most of which were below Grade 3 in intensity.
After further review of cases reporting these AEs, here was no evidence of clinically relevant
findings and that the imbalance was possibly a chance finding. Statistically significant differences in
frequencies of SAEs not favoring the Rotarix group were only seen for MedDRA PT Pneumonia.
However, only one of the cases of pneumonia, occurring in the Rotarix group, had onset within 31
days of vaccination.
The validity of the results was strengthened by the double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center
study design. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity endpoints, case definitions, and study cohorts were
clearly defined and appropriate. Given the limited study population sizes in some of the countries, there
were no significant efficacy or safety imbalances by country. Overall, the study was well-conducted
without any noticeable sources of biases. Data quality was acceptable, and appropriate data analyses
were conducted as stated in the protocol and amendments. Protocol deviations were minor, occurred
infrequently, and did not lead to any SAEs. Subject dropouts and missing data were handled
appropriately and according to protocol.
The applicant stated that the proposed indication for Rotarix is the prevention of rotavirus
gastroenteritis caused by G1 and non-G1 types (including G2, G3, G4, G9). Results from Rota-036
support the use of Rotarix in the prevention of any and RV GE. Efficacy data supports the use of
Rotarix in the prevention of any and severe RV GE caused by G1 wild-type strains; VE was
statistically significant for Year 1, Year 2, and the combined efficacy periods. Efficacy data also
supports the use of Rotarix in the prevention of any and severe RV GE caused by non-G1 types
when pooled together. When VE was assessed for each non-G1 type individually, Rotarix
demonstrated statistically significant efficacy against any and severe G9 RV GE during all three
study periods. Statistically significant efficacy against any and severe G3 RV GE was demonstrated
during Year 1 and the combined efficacy period. However, the lower limit of the 95% CIs against
any and severe G3 RV GE during Year 1 were low. Efficacy against any and severe G4 RV GE was
statistically significant during Year 1 and the combined efficacy period. Statistically significant VE
was demonstrated against any and severe G2 RV GE during the Year 2 and combined period,
although the lower limit of the 95% CI was low for each estimate.

Design Overview

Rota-004 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at multiple sites in
Finland. Healthy subjects 6 to 12 weeks of age at the time of Dose 1 were randomized to receive 2
doses of either Rotarix (104.7 ffu) or placebo on a 0, 2-month schedule. Subjects were randomized
and administered Dose 1 of Rotarix or placebo on the same day (i.e. Day 0). Feeding 1 hour prevaccination was not allowed. Routine vaccinations were administered 14 days apart from study
vaccination. A total enrollment of 360 evaluable subjects was targeted (Rotarix-240, placebo-120).
The intended study duration was 2 years.

a. Presentation of the results obtained until Visit 4 (end of the 1st RV season) in
a summary form at medical congresses
b. Additional testing of GE stool samples that were negative for RV by RT-PCR
to detect the presence of other gastrointestinal viruses in order to establish the
etiology of the gastrointestinal symptoms for the research interest of the PI. This additional
testing of the stool samples was the responsibility of the PI and the results of the analyses
were not described in the annex study report written after study end.

Vaccination with Rotarix or placebo took place at Visits 1 and 2. Subjects received a physical
examination at all visits.
Safety diary cards for solicited and unsolicited symptoms were collected at Visits 2 and 3. On day
14 post-dose, a study nurse contacted the parents/guardians by telephone or other methods to
remind them to bring the completed diary card at the next visit. GE diary cards for individual GE
episodes were collected at Visits 3, 4, and 5.
Pre-vaccination blood samples were obtained from all subjects at Visit 1, while post-vaccination
blood samples were drawn at Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5.

GE Case Ascertainment
Follow-up of GE symptoms for VE assessment was conducted from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until Visit
5. During each RV disease season post-vaccination, a study nurse contacted the parents/guardians
by telephone every 2 weeks to check for the occurrence of any GE symptoms. Parents/guardians
were also asked to contact the study nurse or investigator for any symptoms suggestive of GE from
2 weeks post-Dose 2 until Visit 5.
GE Case Follow-Up
For each GE episode that occurred from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until Visit 5, a diary card was
completed daily by parents/guardians until symptoms resolved, and returned to the investigator at
the following study visit. The GE diary card allowed assessment recording of rectal temperature,
number of vomiting episodes, and number of looser than normal stools. During each GE episode,
the study nurse contacted the parents/guardians by telephone every day until symptoms resolve.
The 20-point (Vesikari) scale was used to assess the intensity of each GE episode.
For each GE episode, stool samples were collected no later than 7 days after illness onset. At least
2 samples were collected on different days for GE episodes lasting more than one day. Samples
were also collected from the day of Dose 1 until 2 weeks post-Dose 2. Samples were frozen until
returned to the investigation site; refrigerated samples were returned within 24 hours after collection.
Stool samples were analyzed by ELISA at the laboratory of Dr. R. Ward in Cincinnati, US, and by RTPCR at the laboratory of ----------------- in Finland. Specimens in which RV was detected were further
analyzed by RT-PCR to determine G type. A subset of stool samples was used for ELISA and RT-PCR
validation at GSK’s laboratory in Belgium.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
AE/SAE Monitoring, including IS
Solicited symptoms (fever, fussiness/irritability, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea) occurring from
Day 0 to Day 14 after each dose were monitored using diary cards.
Unsolicited symptoms occurring within 42 days after each dose were recorded for all subjects.
SAEs occurring throughout the study period were recorded for all subjects.
SAE monitoring, including IS, was conducted using similar procedures in Rota-023 and Rota-036.
Procedures for grading intensity of unsolicited AEs/SAEs, assessing causality of AEs/SAEs to
vaccination, follow-up of AEs/SAEs, and SAE reporting were also similar to Rota-023 and Rota-036.
Unsolicited symptoms were coded using WHO’s Dictionary for Adverse Reaction Terminology.
Every verbatim term from safety reports was matched to an appropriate WHO Preferred Term.
IS Case Ascertainment and Follow-up
Follow-up diagnostic procedures for IS cases were similar to that in Rota-023 and Rota-036. Each
IS case was reviewed by external advisers.
Serology Analysis
Sera were collected from all subjects at Visit 1 (pre-Dose 1), Visit 3 (1 month post-Dose 2), Visit 4,
and Visit 5. Anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations were measured by ELISA at Dr. Ward’s laboratory,
with a subset used for ELISA validation at GSK in Belgium.

Statistical Considerations

Power Considerations - Primary Efficacy Objective
Assuming a true VE of 70%, a frequency of RV GE of 20% in the placebo group from 2 weeks postDose 2 until the end of the 1st RV disease season, 240 subjects in the Rotarix and 120 in the
placebo groups, the study had 95% power to observe a LL of the VE 95% CI of 46%.
Study Cohorts
Total vaccinated cohorts (TVCs) consisted of all subjects for whom data (safety, efficacy,
immunogenicity) were available, and underwent the following analyses:
- Secondary safety analysis (TVC for safety)
- Secondary immunogenicity analysis if needed (TVC for immunogenicity)
- Secondary efficacy analysis (TVC for efficacy)
The ATP safety (reactogenicity) cohort consisted of vaccinated subjects who 1) received at least 1
dose of vaccine/placebo according to their random assignment, 2) had sufficient data to perform
safety analysis (i.e. had at least one documented dose), 3) did not receive a vaccine forbidden by or
not specified in the protocol, 4) did not have their randomization codes broken and did not receive a
replacement vial, and 5) were negative for serum anti-RV IgA antibodies on the day of Dose 1. The
ATP safety cohort was to have been used for the primary safety analysis.
The ATP efficacy cohort consisted of all subjects from the ATP safety cohort who 1) received 2 doses
of vaccine/placebo according to their random assignment, 2) had entered into the surveillance period
(had follow-up beyond 2 weeks post-Dose 2), and 3) had no RV other than vaccine strain in stool
samples collected between the day of Dose 1 and 2 weeks post-Dose 2. The ATP efficacy cohort was
used for primary efficacy analysis.
The ATP immunogenicity cohort consisted of all subjects from the ATP safety cohort who 1)
complied with blood sample and vaccination schedules per protocol, 2) had not received medication
forbidden by the protocol, 3) did not have an underlying medical condition forbidden by the protocol,
4) had no protocol violation of demographics, 5) had immunogenicity data for IgA antibodies at preDose 2 and 1 month post-Dose 2, 6) had no RV other than vaccine strain in stool samples collected
from Dose 1 until Visit 3, and 7) had no concomitant infection unrelated to the vaccine which may
have influenced the immune response. The ATP immunogenicity cohort was used for the primary
immunogenicity analysis.
Subjects excluded from the ATP cohorts were identified before data analysis after a review of
individual subject data blinded to group allocation.
Final Analyses
The following analyses were performed:
1. Demographics: age and height/weight (mean, range, and SD per group), race, gender
2. Efficacy:
a. VE against RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until end of 1st RV season
b. VE against severe RV GE from end of 1st RV season until end of 2nd RV season
c. VE against any and severe RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until end of 2nd RV season
d. VE against any and severe GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until end of 2nd RV season
e. VE against asymptomatic RV GE from 1 month post-Dose 2 until end of each RV season
If a subject reported multiple episodes of GE, only the most severe episode was included in the
efficacy analysis.
An episode of GE was classified as RV positive if stool samples were positive by ELISA/RT-PCR.

117

Samples collected at Visits 4 and 5 were used to detect asymptomatic RV infections.
The 95% CIs for VE were derived using a conditional to cases approach. In addition, the Cox
proportional-hazard model including the group effect as the only regressor was used to estimate VE
(and 95% CI) against the primary endpoint for exploratory analysis.
3. Immunogenicity:
a. Seroconversion rates 1 month post-Dose 2, Visit 4, and Visit 5, by group (for ATP cohort,
seroconversion rate= seropositivity rate)
b. GMTs of IgA antibody, by group, by time point; antibody titers below the cut-off of the assay
will be given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off
c. % of subjects reporting at least one RV GE episode during the 1st efficacy follow-up period,
by serological status for IgA antibody concentration one month post-Dose 2
4. Safety
a. Overall incidence of any AEs (solicited and unsolicited), by group, by dose, for overall doses, per
subject; same calculations for Grade 3 and vaccine-related symptoms
b. Incidence of each solicited general symptom, by group, over the follow-up period, after each dose,
for all doses, per subject; same calculations for Grade 3 and vaccine-related AEs
c. Number of subjects with presence of RV in stool samples collected in case of diarrhea and/or
vomiting from day of Dose 1 until 2 weeks post-Dose 2
d. % of subjects with unsolicited symptoms within Days 0-42, by WHO body system/WHO preferred
terms; similar tabulations for vaccine-related unsolicited symptoms
e. Number of subjects reporting at least one SAE, per group
f. % of subjects who took ≥1 concomitant medication during the solicited follow-up period, per group
g. SAEs described in detail
As an exploratory analysis, the following was compared between groups using Fisher Exact test:
- % of subjects with at least one symptom (solicited/unsolicited) from Days 0-14 post-dose
- % of subjects reporting specific solicited symptoms from Days 0-14 post-dose
- % of subjects reporting unsolicited symptoms classified by WHO Preferred Terms from Day
0 to Day 42 post-dose
Final statistical analysis
A final statistical analysis was performed at the end of the 1st RV disease season and presented
results of objectives related to the period from Visit 1 until Visit 4. Data analyses from Visit 4 until
Visit 5, as well as efficacy analyses over both efficacy follow-up periods, were presented as an
annex. Access to individual treatment decode was strictly controlled and restricted to some GSK
Biologicals’ personnel.
Interim analysis
An unplanned interim analysis of uncleaned efficacy data was performed after completion of Visit 4.
VE against any RV GE was calculated, with results being kept in-house and no report being written.
Individual decoding during this analysis was restricted to the statistician and the database
administrator. Results of this analysis were consistent with the results in the Final Study Report.
Additional analyses/changes
Changes were made to the planned analyses included the following:
- The TVC was used for the primary safety analysis instead of the ATP cohort
- One stool sample per GE episode occurring after December 1, 2000 was tested by RT-PCR at
--------------- laboratory, irrespective of positive or negative ELISA results
- A few samples collected before December 1, 2000 that tested negative by ELISA were
mistakenly tested by RT-PCR and found positive; one subject, who tested negative by
ELISA but positive by RT-PCR before December 1, 2000, was considered as having a RV
GE in the efficacy calculation using RT-PCR method
- An unplanned interim analysis was performed (see above)

118

-

Intensity of GE episodes from Day of Dose 1 until 2 weeks post-Dose 2 was calculated
95% CIs for VE were derived according to the method described in the Report Analysis Plan
(RAP, detailed in Appendix B) rather than using the Mantel-Haenszel approach specified in
the protocol
Seroconversion rate, VE against severe RV GE, and VE against hospitalization due to any
GE during the 1st efficacy period were calculated in accordance with the RAP
VE against hospitalization due to any GE during 2nd and combined efficacy periods
GMCs to anti-RV IgA antibody on seropositive subjects were calculated
Access to the treatment code for some subjects was made available to the GSK Biologicals’
Clinical Team prior to study end; this was done because efficacy analysis of the 1st RV season
revealed that subjects who had seroconverted were better protected against natural infection than
those who had not. In order to completely analyze the possible correlation between immunological
markers and efficacy, access to the treatment code for subjects with RV GE (ELISA/RT-PCR
positive) during the 1st RV season was given to the Clinical Development Manager and Director
prior to study end.
ELISA or RT-PCR tests were repeated for 4 subjects (Year 1 – 1, Year 2 – 3) due to
inconsistencies in test results; RT-PCR test was performed for 2 subjects (Year 1 – 1, Year
2 – 2) with previous missing results; calculations pertaining to the main study objectives (i.e.
VE) were redone with corrected ELISA and RT-PCR results
Quantitative PCR and sequencing were conducted post-hoc to help distinguish RV G1 wild
type versus vaccine strain for 5 Rotarix recipients who reported G1 RV GE detected by RTPCR but not by ELISA
Sequencing of G1 strains from GE episodes reported from Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2
was conducted post-hoc to distinguish between RV G1 wild type versus vaccine strain

Protocol deviations – ATP efficacy cohort for 1st follow-up period
Protocol deviations leading to subject exclusion from the ATP cohort were as follows:
- 4 (Rotarix-4) received DTP vaccination in time window forbidden in the protocol
- 3 (Rotarix-2, placebo-1) had randomization failure
- 1 (Rotarix-1) received study dose not administered per protocol (subject vomited 10 minutes
after vaccine administration)
- 6 (Rotarix-4, placebo-2) had unknown RV serological status on the day of Dose 1
- 22 (Rotarix-13, placebo-9) did not receive Dose 2 of Rotarix or placebo
- 1 (Rotarix-1) did not enter into the surveillance period of the 1st efficacy follow-up
A total of 368 subjects were included in the ATP efficacy cohort.
Protocol deviations – ATP immunogenicity cohort
Protocol deviations leading to subject exclusion from the ATP cohort were as follows:
- 3 (Rotarix-1, placebo-2) were administered medication forbidden in the protocol

Efficacy endpoints/outcomes

Year 1 Efficacy (2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 4) – ATP efficacy cohort
Summary of reported any RV GE and severe RV GE episodes – Year 1
The median duration of follow-up during the Year 1 efficacy period was approximately 5.6 months in
each group. Numbers of GE and RV GE episodes, as well as numbers of subjects, are depicted for
each group in the table below. RV was detected by ELISA in 8 GE episodes of Rotarix recipients

121

and 13 episodes in placebo recipients. RV was detected by RT-PCR in 12 GE episodes from each
group. No subject in either group had more than one RV GE episode during the 1st efficacy followup period

Applicant Erratum Note: As mentioned previously, inconsistencies in laboratory results of stool
samples for 2 subjects resulted in the following:
- One Rotarix recipient who initially tested positive for RV by ELISA and negative by RT-PCR
was found to be negative by ELISA upon repeat testing; thus, this subject was reclassified
as RV negative (by ELISA and RT-PCR)
- One placebo recipient who had not been initially tested by RT-PCR was RT-PCR positive for
G1 type after testing; thus this subject was reclassified as RV positive (by RT-PCR)

RT-PCR

Applicant Post-hoc Laboratory Analyses: Of the 5 Rotarix recipients who tested positive by RTPCR and negative by ELISA, 4 had negative or very low RV load in their retested stool samples.
Sequencing data showed that the RV strains in 4 of the 5 subjects were the vaccine strain, while
the fifth subject was infected with a wild type G1 RV; however, this subject had a negative stool viral
load, leading to the possibility of false positive results. All 5 subjects had mild GE and could have
possibly been infected by other pathogens.
ELISA results for GE stool samples were not available for 7.1% of episodes in the Rotarix group and
5.1% of episodes in the placebo group. RT-PCR results were not available for 9.8% of episodes in the
Rotarix group and 6.8% of episodes in the placebo group. Results were unavailable due to noncollection of stool samples, invalid test results or non-testing of samples.
Reviewer Note: Due to the reclassification of the Rotarix recipient mentioned previously who was
tested by RT-PCR after not being previously tested by this method, the percentage of RT-PCR
results not available for GE episodes in the Rotarix group should have been recalculated. However,
the applicant did not provide the corrected estimate.
Clinical characteristics of RV GE episodes – Year 1
The duration of looser than normal stools and vomiting were shorter in the Rotarix group compared
to the placebo group. The frequencies of fever ≥ 39.0°C, dehydration, and rehydration treatment

123

were also less in the Rotarix group compared to placebo. No episodes in either group required
hospitalization.
Reviewer Note: Due to the reclassification of the 2 subjects mentioned previously, clinical
characteristics of RV GE episodes for each group should have been recalculated. However, the
applicant did not provide corrected figures.
Vaccine efficacy against any RV GE detected by ELISA – Year 1 (Primary endpoint)
VE against any RV GE as detected by ELISA during the 1st efficacy follow-up period was 69.1%
(95% CI: 19.6-88.9%). A similar estimate was obtained using the Cox proportional-hazard mode
(results not included in the study report).

A total of 381 subjects (Rotarix-255, placebo-126) were included in Year 1 efficacy analyses. The
median duration of follow-up during this interval was 5.6 months for both groups.
Summary of reported RV GE episodes
The numbers of any and severe RV GE episodes for each group and for each RV detection
method, as well as the numbers of RV GE episodes by serotype, were the same as in the ATP

Year 2 Efficacy (After Visit 4 to Visit 5) – ATP efficacy cohort
Summary of reported any RV GE and severe RV GE episodes – Year 2
The median duration of follow-up during the 2nd efficacy period was 1 year in each group. RV was
detected by ELISA in 7 GE episodes of Rotarix recipients and 12 episodes in placebo recipients.
RV was detected by RT-PCR in 6 GE episodes of Rotarix and 10 episodes of placebo recipients.
One subject (Rotarix group) had 2 RV GE episodes during the 2nd efficacy follow-up period
(detected by ELISA). This subject had 2 episodes separated by 9 days. Both were graded as very
mild and tested positive for RV by ELISA; one episode tested positive for G1 by RT-PCR.

Applicant Erratum note: As mentioned previously, inconsistencies in laboratory results of stool
samples for 4 subjects resulted in the following:
- One Rotarix recipient and one placebo recipient initially RV positive by ELISA and negative
by RT-PCR were negative by ELISA upon repeat testing; thus, these subjects were
reclassified as RV negative (by ELISA and RT-PCR)
- One placebo recipient not been initially tested by RT-PCR was RT-PCR positive for G1 type
after testing; this subject was reclassified as RV positive (by RT-PCR)
- One Rotarix recipient previously negative by RT-PCR was RT-PCR positive for G1 type after
retesting; this patient also a separate episode of G1 RV GE during Year 1

RT-PCR

ELISA results for GE stool samples during the 2nd efficacy period were not available for 7.1% of
episodes in the Rotarix group and 9.9% of episodes in the placebo group. RT-PCR results were not
available for 4.3% of episodes in the Rotarix and 6.6% of episodes in the placebo groups. Results
were unavailable due to non-collection of stools, invalid test results or non-testing of samples.
Reviewer Note: Due to the reclassification of the 1 placebo recipient mentioned previously who
was tested by RT-PCR after not being previously tested by this method, the percentage of RT-PCR
results not available for GE episodes in the placebo group should have been recalculated.
However, the applicant did not provide the corrected figure.
Clinical characteristics of RV GE episodes – Year 2
The duration of vomiting was shorter in the Rotarix group compared to the placebo group. The
frequencies of fever ≥ 39.0°C was also less in the Rotarix group compared to placebo. One episode
in the Rotarix group required hospitalization.
Reviewer Note: Due to the reclassification of the 4 subjects mentioned previously, clinical
characteristics of RV GE episodes for each group should have been recalculated. However, the
applicant did not provide corrected figures.

Combined Efficacy (2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 5) – ATP efficacy cohort
The ATP efficacy cohort used for Year 1 was also used for the combined efficacy period. The
median duration of follow-up during this period was approximately 17.6 months in each group.
Summary of reported any RV GE and severe RV GE episodes – Combined period
RV was detected by ELISA in 16 GE episodes of Rotarix recipients and 25 episodes in placebo
recipients. RV was detected by RT-PCR in 18 GE episodes of Rotarix recipients and 23 episodes of
placebo recipients.

133

Two subject (Rotarix-1, placebo-1) had 2 RV GE episode during the 2nd efficacy period. The Rotarix
recipient has been previously discussed under the Year 1 Efficacy section. The placebo recipient had
one G2 RV GE episode during Year 1 and one G1 RV GE during Year 2; both episodes were
classified as severe. This subject had anti-RV IgA antibodies at the end of Year 1.

VE against any RV GE by main RV serotypes – Combined period (Secondary endpoint)
VE against any G1 RV GE detected by ELISA was 71.3% (95% CI: 38.9-87.1%). VE detected by
RT-PCR was 61.7% (95% CI: 23.1-81.3). VE against G2 and G9 RV GE was 100% and 49.8%,
respectively, although 95% CIs for both estimates were wide and crossed 0 due to limited case
numbers of these two serotypes.
Applicant Erratum Note: Due to the reclassification of the 6 subjects mentioned previously, VE
against any G1 RV GE detected by ELISA was recalculated as 72.6% (95% CI: 42.2-87.6%). VE
against any G1 RV GE detected by RT-PCR was recalculated as 63.5% (95% CI: 27.2-82.1%).
VE against severe RV GE by main RV serotypes – Combined period (Secondary endpoint)
VE against severe G1 RV GE detected by ELISA or by RT-PCR was 90.0% (95% CI: 52.9-98.9%).
VE against severe G2 RV GE was 100%, although the 95% CI for was very wide and crossed 0 due
to limited case numbers of this serotype. VE against severe G9 RV GE could not be calculated due
to limited case numbers.
VE against any GE – Combined period (Secondary endpoint)
VE against GE of any etiology was -1.7% (95% CI: -34.6-22.7%).

Combined Efficacy (2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Visit 5) – TVC for efficacy
The TVC for efficacy used for Year 1 was also used for the combined efficacy period. The median
duration of follow-up during the combined efficacy period was 17.6 months in each group.
Summary of reported RV GE episodes
The numbers of any and severe RV GE episodes for each group and for each RV detection
method, as well as the numbers of RV GE episodes by G serotype, were the same as in the ATP
efficacy cohort.
VE against any RV GE – Combined period
VE against any RV GE detected by ELISA during the combined period was 69.1% (95% CI: 38.784.9%), similar to the VE estimate for the ATP cohort. VE against any RV GE detected by RT-PCR
was 61.8% (95% CI: 24.7-81.0%).
Reviewer Note: Due to the reclassification of the 6 subjects mentioned previously, VE against any
RV GE detected by ELISA and by RT-PCR during the combined period should have been
recalculated. However, the applicant did not provide the corrected VE estimates.
VE against severe RV GE – Combined period
VE of Rotarix against severe RV GE as detected by ELISA or by RT-PCR during the combined
period was 85.2% (95% CI: 42.4-97.4%), similar to the VE estimate for the ATP cohort.
VE against any RV GE by main RV serotypes – Combined period
VE against any G1 RV GE detected by ELISA was 71.8% (95% CI: 39.9-87.3%). VE against any
G1 RV GE detected by RT-PCR was 62.4% (95% CI: 24.3-81.6%). VE against G2 and G9 RV GE
detected either by ELISA or RT-PCR was 100% and 50.6%, respectively, although 95% CIs for
both estimates were wide and crossed 0 due to limited case numbers of these two serotypes.
Reviewer Note: Due to the reclassification of the 6 subjects mentioned previously, VE against any
G1 RV GE detected by ELISA and by RT-PCR during the combined period should have been
recalculated. However, the applicant did not provide the corrected VE estimates.
VE against severe RV GE by main RV serotypes – Combined period
VE against severe G1 RV GE detected by ELISA or by RT-PCR was 90.1% (95% CI: 53.6-98.9%).
VE against severe G2 RV GE was 100%, although the 95% CI for was very wide and crossed 0 due
to limited case numbers of this serotype. VE against severe G9 RV GE could not be calculated due
to limited case numbers.
VE against any GE – Combined period (Secondary endpoint)
VE against GE of any etiology was 0.6% (95% CI: -31.2-24.2%).
VE against severe GE – Combined period (Secondary endpoint)
VE against severe GE of any etiology was 46.1% (95% CI: -34.8-78.2%).

However, corrected figures were not provided.
Combined Efficacy (Visit 3 to Visit 5) – TVC for efficacy
VE against asymptomatic infection – Combined period (Secondary endpoint)
291 subjects (Rotarix-201, placebo-90) were included for the analysis of VE against asymptomatic
RV infection detected by ELISA from Visit 3 to Visit 5. VE was 77.6% (95% CI: 28.1-94.0%).
292 subjects (Rotarix-200, placebo-92) were included for the analysis of VE against asymptomatic
RV infection detected by RT-PCR from Visit 3 to Visit 5. VE was 79.1% (95% CI: 34.7-94.3%).
Reviewer Note: Due to the reclassification of 6 subjects mentioned previously, VE estimate figures
for both detection methods should have been corrected. However, corrected figures were not
provided.
Year 2 – TVC for immunogenicity
A total of 404 subjects (Rotarix-269, placebo-135) were included in this immunogenicity analysis.
Applicant Erratum Note: GMC results for 4 subjects (Rotarix-2, placebo-2) were modified after
Year 1 immunogenicity analyses; 1 subject (Rotarix group) had a modified result for Visit 3 GMC,
while 3 subjects (Rotarix-1, placebo-2) had modified results for Visit 4 GMC. These modified results
were included in the immunogenicity analyses below.
Reviewer Note: The applicant did not state why immunogenicity analyses for Year 2 were not also
performed on the ATP immunogenicity cohort.
Anti-RV IgA response
Seropositivity rates and GMCs at pre-vaccination, 1 month post-Dose 2, end of 1st RV season, and
end of 2nd RV season, are summarized below. These results demonstrate a decrease in both
seropositivity rates and GMCs from Visit 3 to Visit 5 in the Rotarix group. However, these decreases
did not parallel a decrease in VE from Years 1 to 2, as VE of both periods were similar.

Solicited general AEs – Days 0-14 post-dose
The differences in incidence of total AEs for each symptom after any dose were not statistically
significant between Rotarix and placebo groups except for loss of appetite, which occurred in 38.9%
in the Rotarix group compared to 28.6% in the placebo group.
Irritability/fussiness was the most common AE in both groups (Rotarix-77.0%, placebo-71.4%) after
each dose, followed by loss of appetite and fever. Diarrhea AEs were the least common in both
groups. Grade 3 AEs were less common for each symptom, and were reported at a similar
incidence both groups. Grade 3 AEs that were reported at a rate ≥ 1% and <10% in the Rotarix
group were diarrhea (1.9%), fussiness/irritability (8.3%), and vomiting (4.5%). The majority of
solicited symptoms were assessed as related to vaccination; for each symptom, the 95% CIs for
both groups overlapped.

Incidences for each symptom were comparable between groups after each dose. Only fever
demonstrated a noticeable increase in incidence from Dose 1 to Dose 2 in both groups. This may
have been due to Dose 2 being administered between mid-October and end-January during which
time the incidences of common cold or other winter-related conditions are higher. Grade 3 fever
rarely occurred in either group.

There was no noticeable peak day in the prevalence of diarrhea, vomiting, or fever from Day 0 to
Day 14 after either dose for either group. Mean duration of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever during the
15-day period after each dose were similar between groups, ranging from 1.5 to 3 days. In the
Rotarix group, all three symptoms lasted slightly longer after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1.

143

Seven subjects (Rotarix-6, placebo-1) experienced diarrhea and vomiting simultaneously during the
15-day solicited follow-up period. One of these subject reported Grade 3 symptoms after Dose 1;
G1 RV was detected by RT-PCR in stool samples, while ELISA results were negative for RV.
Another subject, who reported grade 1 diarrhea and vomiting, tested positive for RV by ELISA and
G1 type by RT-PCR.
RV GE – Day of Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2
Among Rotarix recipients, RV was detected by ELISA in 9 GE episodes from 9 (3.4%) subjects and
by RT-PCR in 19 episodes from 17 (6.4%) subjects. G1 type was detected in all RT-PCR-positive
cases, and all ELISA-positive cases were also RT-PCR-positive. Sequencing was not performed to
distinguish wild-type versus vaccine G1 virus. Of all the ELISA and/or RT-PCR positive subjects
with GE data needed to determine disease severity, none were graded as severe RV GE (although
severity grading was unknown for 2 of the 9 episodes detected by ELISA and 4 of the 19 episodes
detected by RT-PCR). No placebo subject tested positive for RV by either test method.
Applicant Post-hoc Analyses: Sequencing analyses of RV identified from the 19 GE episodes
showed that 17 were vaccine strains, one was a wild type strain, and one was negative. Of the 17
episodes with vaccine G1 RV strains, onset of GE from previous Rotarix dose ranged from 0 to 40
days (median – 2 days).
Reviewer Note: In Study Rota-004, inclusion in the ATP efficacy cohort required that a subject had
no RV other than vaccine strain in stool samples collected between the day of Dose 1 and 2 weeks
post-Dose 2. Similarly, inclusion in the ATP immunogenicity cohort required that a subject had no
RV other than vaccine strain in stool samples collected from Dose 1 until Visit 3. In the applicant’s
post-hoc analysis, one subject with G1 wild type strain based on sequencing analysis was
identified. However, based on information provided in the study reports and analyses databases,
this subject was not excluded from either the ATP efficacy or immunogenicity cohorts.
Unsolicited AEs – Days 0- 42 post-dose
The percentages of subjects with at least one unsolicited AE of any kind were similar between
groups (Rotarix-190, 71.2%; placebo-93, 69.9%). There were no statistically significant differences
between groups for any WHO Preferred Term. In Rotarix recipients, PTs that were reported at a
rate ≥ 10% (in subjects reporting the specified AE at least once) were rhinitis (26.2%), nervousness
(24%) and fever (13.9%). PTs that were reported at a rate ≥ 1% and <10% in the Rotarix group
were abnormal crying (2.6%), pain (4.1%), abdominal pain (4.1%), anorexia (1.1%), constipation
(3.4%), diarrhea (2.6%), flatulence (6.4%), gastroesophageal reflux (6.7%), tooth ache (2.2%),
vomiting (1.5%), insomnia (1.9%), viral infection (2.6%), moniliasis (2.2%), otitis media (8.2%),
upper respiratory tract infection (9.4%), coughing (9.7%), eczema (3.4%), rash (2.2%), and
conjunctivitis (7.5%).
The percentages of subjects with at least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE was less in the Rotarix
compared to the placebo group (17, 6.4% versus 13, 9.8%). There were no noticeable differences
between groups for any WHO Preferred Term. In Rotarix recipients, there were no Grade 3 PTs
reported at a rate ≥ 10%. Grade 3 PTs that were reported at a rate ≥ 1% and <10% in the Rotarix
group were fever (1.1%), flatulence (1.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.1%), rhinitis (1.5%).
The percentages of subjects with at least one vaccine-related unsolicited AE was more in the
Rotarix group compared to the placebo group (40, 15% versus 14, 10.5%), although 95% CIs for
both groups overlapped. Among the WHO Preferred Terms, Abdominal Pain (3.0% versus 0.8%)
and Flatulence (3.7% versus 0.8%) were reported slightly more in the Rotarix group than in the
placebo group, although 95% CIs for both groups overlapped for each of the PTs. Other vaccinerelated PTs that were reported at a rate ≥ 1% and <10% in the Rotarix group were fatigue (1.9%)
and gastroesophageal reflux (5.6%). There were no vaccine-related AEs reported at a rate ≥ 10%.
Unsolicited AEs that were both Grade 3 and vaccine-related are summarized below.

Reviewer Note: The reviewer obtained a total of 63 Rotarix subjects who had at least 1 unsolicited
gastrointestinal AE, based on the analysis data provided by the applicant. Because this number did
not differ substantially from those provided by the applicant, the reviewer feels comfortable
accepting the figure submitted by the applicant.
Concomitant medications/vaccinations – Days 0-14 post-dose
The percentages of subjects who started taking any medication and any antipyretics after each
dose were comparable between groups. Overall, 63.3% of Rotarix recipients and 63.0% of placebo
recipients started taking a medication between Visit 1 and Visit 4.
SAEs – Dose 1 to Visit 4
Nineteen subjects (Rotarix-15 [5.6%], placebo-4 [3.0%]) reported at least one SAE during this
interval. None of the SAEs were judged to be related to study vaccination. No cases of IS were
reported. The distributions of SAEs by WHO Body System or WHO Preferred Term were not
provided in the report.
Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer found a total of 26
SAEs during this period; one (PT Growth retarded) had onset before this interval. Of the remaining
25 SAEs, only 5 had onset between Day 0 and Day 19 post-dose (PTs Appetite increased, Crying
abnormal, Seborrhea, Pneumonia, and Infection viral). Pneumonia (1.5%) was the only SAE PT
reported at a rate ≥ 1% in the Rotarix group.
Deaths – Dose 1 to Visit 4
No deaths were reported during this interval.
SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out at Visit 4
No subjects dropped out of the study due to SAEs.
Eight subjects (Rotarix-6, placebo-2) dropped out at Visit 4 due to non-SAEs. Of these, 5 subjects
had vaccine-related AEs consisting mostly of Grade 1/Grade 2 diarrhea, vomiting, irritability, and
vomiting. Vaccine-related Grade 3 AEs occurred as follows: vomiting 4 days post-Dose 2 in a
Rotarix recipient, colicky stomach ache 2 days post-Dose 2 in a Rotarix recipient, and irritability 2
days post-Dose 1 in a Rotarix recipient. Of the non-vaccine-related AEs, one placebo subject had
Grade 2 melena 1 day post-Dose 2, one Rotarix subject had 2 RV negative GE episodes 16 days
(Grade 2) and 57 days (Grade 1) post-Dose 1, and one Rotarix subject had Grade 2 cough 5 days
post-Dose 1 along with Grade 2 shortness of breath 9 days post-Dose.

Year 2 safety (after Visit 4 to Visit 5) – TVC
SAEs – after Visit 4 to Visit 5
During this interval, 20 subjects (Rotarix-13, placebo-7) reported at least one SAE during this
interval. None of the SAEs were judged to be related to study vaccination. No cases of IS were
reported. The distributions of SAEs by WHO Body System or WHO Preferred Term were not
provided in the report.
Reviewer Note: Based on analysis data provided by the applicant, the reviewer found a total of 28
SAEs during this period. Onsets of the SAEs ranged from 57 to 558 days after the last study dose.
There were no noticeable imbalances in specific SAEs between groups. SAE PTs that were
reported at a rate ≥ 1% in the Rotarix group were Bronchitis (1.9%) and Pneumonia (1.5%).
Deaths – after Visit 4 to Visit 5
No deaths were reported during this interval.
SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out at Visit 5 - after Visit 4 to Visit 5
There were no SAEs or non-SAES that lead to drop out at Visit 5 during this interval.
Individual report forms reviewed
Individual case narratives were reviewed for all SAEs reported up to Visit 4.
8.1.3.3 Comments & Conclusions
In Rota-004, two doses of Rotarix at a lower concentration of vaccine virus (104.7 ffu of RIX4414)
than that used in the 2 pivotal trials (Rota-023 and Rota-036), administered to children 6 to 12
weeks 2 months apart, demonstrated efficacy of 73.0% against any RV GE detected by ELISA
during the 1st efficacy period. VE against severe RV GE detected either by ELISA during this period
was 90.3%. VE against any RV GE and severe RV GE detected by ELISA during the 2nd efficacy
period was 72.8% and 83.4%, respectively. VE against any RV GE (71.6%) and severe RV GE
(84.9%) during the combined follow-up period were similar to estimates for the 1st efficacy period.
The LLs of the 95% CI for all these estimates were below 50%.
Statistically significant VE was not observed against any wild-type G1 RV GE (64.9%) and severe
G1 RV GE (87.4%) detected by ELISA during the 1st efficacy follow-up period due to limited
numbers of cases. However, statistically significant VE was observed against any wild-type G1 RV
GE (77.4%; LL 95% CI: 20.1%) and severe wild-type G1 RV GE (91.7%; LL 95% CI: 31.6%)
detected by ELISA during the 2nd efficacy follow-up period. VE estimates against any wild-type G1
RV GE (72.6%; LL 95% CI: 42.4%) and severe G1 RV GE (90%) were also statistically significant.
VE estimates against G2 and/or G9 RV GE during any of the follow-up periods were either not
statistically significant or not calculated due to limited case numbers.
Overall, VE estimates against RV GE endpoints detected by RT-PCR were comparable to
estimates using the ELISA method, except for VE against any RV GE during the 1st efficacy period
in which 5 subjects who tested RV positive by RT-PCR were negative by ELISA. Post-hoc analyses
later identified RV vaccine strains in 4 of the 5 subjects.
No cases of IS nor deaths were seen throughout the study. SAEs were relatively infrequent, and
distributions by WHO Preferred Term were not noticeably different between groups. Overall rates of
subjects who experienced a solicited or unsolicited AE from Day 0 to Day 14 post-dose were similar
between treatment groups. Imbalances in rates of solicited AEs between groups were also not
observed, except for loss of appetite which occurred at a higher rate in the Rotarix group. However,
only one grade 3 AE for loss of appetite occurred in either group combined. The percentages of
subjects with at least one unsolicited AE from Day 0 to Day 42 post-dose were similar between
groups. The percentages of subjects with at least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE was less in the
Rotarix group compared to the placebo group. Overall, there were no noticeable differences
between groups for any unsolicited AE by WHO Preferred Term.

146

The validity of the results was strengthened by the double-blinded, placebo-controlled, study
design. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity endpoints, case definitions, and study cohorts were
clearly defined and appropriate. Overall, the study was well-conducted without any noticeable
sources of biases. Data quality was acceptable, and appropriate data analyses were conducted as
stated in the protocol and amendments. Protocol deviations were minor and occurred infrequently.
Subject dropouts and missing data were handled appropriately and according to protocol. Retesting
of stool samples due to initial laboratory inconsistencies was conducted appropriately, with
reanalyses performed for main efficacy endpoints as appropriate. Post-hoc laboratory analyses
were clearly explained and conducted in an acceptable manner.
Results from Rota-004 support the use of Rotarix in the prevention of any and RV GE, although LLs
of the 95% CI were low. Efficacy data supports the use of Rotarix in the prevention of any and
severe RV GE caused by G1 wild-type strains, although VE estimates did not reach statistical
significance during the 1st efficacy follow-up period. VE against other serotypes could not be
adequately assessed due to limited GE cases caused by each non-G1 serotype.

8.1.4.1.2

Design Overview

Rota-006 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-country and multi-center study.
Healthy and previously RV-uninfected subjects 6 to 12 weeks of age at the time of Dose 1 were
randomized to receive 2 doses of either Rotarix at one of 3 virus concentrations (104.7, 105.2, or 105.8
ffu) or placebo on a 0, 2-month schedule. Subjects were randomized and administered Dose 1 of
Rotarix or placebo on the same day (i.e. Day 0). DTPw, Hib, and Hepatitis B vaccines were coadministered with study doses, while OPV was administered either at least 2 weeks before or 2
weeks after study vaccination (amended Feb 12, 2001). A total enrollment of 2360 evaluable
subjects was targeted (590 for each Rotarix concentration, 590 for placebo). All subjects were
followed for efficacy until 1 year of age, and a subset were followed for efficacy until a maximum of
2 years of age (amended Sep 20, 2002, Aug 21, 2003). The duration of the study per subject was
10 months for subjects followed for 1 efficacy period and 22 months at most for subjects followed
for 2 efficacy periods.

†for subset followed for 2 efficacy periods (target N ~1000 subjects, including subjects who did not complete their follow-up visit at 1 year
of age by October 31, 2002); actual dates of final visits in 2003 for subjects from Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela were April 21-May 14,
September 21-November 8, and September 29-October 16, respectively

Vaccination with Rotarix or placebo took place at Visits 1 and 2 for all subjects. All subjects were
co-administered DTPw-HB+Hib vaccine at Visits 1, 2, and 3.
Feeding practices (breast versus formula, fed within 60 minutes pre-vaccination and/or within 30
minutes post-vaccination) were recorded on the day of each study dose.

151

Safety diary cards for solicited and unsolicited symptoms were collected at Visits 2 and 3.
Pre-vaccination blood samples were obtained from all subjects at Visit 1. For all subjects receiving
only 2 doses of Rotarix/placebo, a blood sample was obtained at Visit 5. For a subset of subjects
receiving 2 doses of study vaccine/placebo (N=800), post-dose blood samples were drawn at Visits
2 and 3. This subset was comprised of the first 200 subjects enrolled in each country (200 x 3
countries = 600), with the remaining 200 coming from any of the participating countries according to
the order of enrollment.
Stool samples (non-GE) were collected from a subset of 400 subjects (for vaccine take/viral
shedding analyses) on the day of or 1 day prior to Dose 1 and Dose 2 and on Day 7 post-dose. This
subset was comprised of the first 100 subjects enrolled in each country (100 x 3 countries = 300),
with the remaining 100 coming from any participating country according to the order of enrollment.
GE Case Ascertainment
Active follow-up for GE was conducted via weekly visits to each subject by study personnel starting
from 1 week post-Dose 1 until the end of the 1st efficacy period (and 2nd efficacy period for subjects
followed during Year 2). Visits were done at the subject’s home, health clinic, or other mutually
convenient place. At these follow-up visits, study personnel inquired about the occurrence of GE
episodes and AEs, and collected stool samples. Weekly visits were not required during weeks when
study visits were scheduled.
Parents/guardians were also asked to contact study personnel for any symptoms suggestive of GE.
GE Case Follow-Up
For each GE episode, a diary card was provided by study personnel and completed daily by
parents/guardians until symptoms resolved; cards were collected by study personnel when the
episodes ended. The diary cards were similar to those used in Rota-023 and Rota-036 and assisted
in clinically characterizing GE episodes.
The 20-point (Vesikari) scale was used to assess the intensity of each GE episode.
For each GE episode, stool samples were collected no later than 7 days after illness onset and
brought to the study site as soon as possible or picked up by study personnel at weekly visits.
Stool samples were analyzed by RV antigen assay. Rapid screening at the study sites was
performed using a commercial test (RotaClone, Meridian Diagnostics Inc.). Stool samples that
tested RV positive by RotaClone were also tested locally for enteric pathogens; Enteroaggregative
E. coli and Enteroinvasive E coli were tested at the laboratory of ------------------- in Mexico City.
All stool samples, regardless of RV results using RotaClone, were tested using ELISA to detect RV
at the laboratory of Dr. R. Ward in Cincinnati. Only GE stool analysis performed at Dr. Ward’s
laboratory was considered for efficacy analyses.
All stool samples that tested positive for RV were tested by RT-PCR at GSK’s laboratory in Belgium
to determine G type. G1 RV detected in stool specimens between Visit 1 and Visit 3 was analyzed
by sequencing to distinguish wild type from vaccine RV strains.
Stool analyses of 400 subjects for vaccine take and viral shedding
Provided that the subject had a negative RV ELISA test on Day 0, any detection of vaccine virus in
any stool collected after vaccination up to Visit 3 was considered evidence of a vaccine take (i.e.
vaccine response). Also, provided that a pre-vaccination stool sample tested ELISA negative, any
detection of RV in a stool collected 7 days post-vaccination was considered evidence of a vaccine
take. RV ELISA testing was performed at Dr. Ward’s laboratory.
Site-specific study of anti-RV IgA in feces, Venezuela
Fecal RV IgA immune response and the role of IgA antibodies as a marker of protection were to
have been evaluated in a subset of 200 infants from Venezuela. Stool samples were collected at

152

Days 0, 14, and 28 post-dose, then every 2 months from 6 months of age until Visit 4. For each GE
episode, one stool sample each was collected 1-5 days and 14 days after symptom onset. All stool
samples were tested by ELISA to determine fecal anti-RV IgA levels.
AE/SAE Monitoring, including IS
Solicited symptoms, unsolicited AEs, and SAEs were monitored similarly as in Rota-004.
SAE monitoring, including IS, was conducted using similar procedures in Rota-004, Rota-023 and
Rota-036. Procedures for grading the intensity of unsolicited AEs/SAEs, assessing causality of
AEs/SAEs to vaccination, follow-up of AEs/SAEs, and SAE reporting were also similar to those in
Rota-004, Rota-023 and Rota-036.
Unsolicited symptoms were coded similarly as in Rota-004.
IS Case Ascertainment and Follow-up
Follow-up diagnostic procedures for IS cases were similar to Rota-004, Rota-023 and Rota-036.
Serology Analysis
Anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations were measured by ELISA at Dr. Ward’s laboratory and/or
GSK’s laboratory in Belgium. Testing for RV was performed on samples collected at Visit 1 (preDose 1), Visit 2 (post-Dose 1), Visit 3 (post-Dose 2), and Year 1.
Antibodies to PRP, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, pertussis components, and HBsAg were
measured by ELISA. Antibodies to polio viruses types 1, 2, and 3 were determined by ------------------- test, with titers expressed in terms of the 50% inhibitory dose. Serological testing for
routine childhood vaccine antigens was performed on samples collected at Visit 3 and Year 1 visit.
Forms

Statistical Considerations

Power Considerations - Primary Efficacy Objective
Due to difficulty in enrolling subjects, the targeted number of evaluable subjects was decreased
from 2360 (590 per group) to 1840 (460 per group). Assuming a true VE of 70%, a frequency of RV
GE of 12% in the placebo group from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until the end of the 1st RV disease
season, and 460 subjects in each treatment group, the study had 88.9% power to observe a lower
limit of the VE 95% CI above 30%. Although the actual observed attack rate for any RV GE was
10.8%, the study still had 82% power to observe a lower limit of the VE 95% CI above 30%.
Power Considerations – Secondary Efficacy Objective (2nd follow-up period)
Assuming a true VE of 60%, a frequency of RV GE of 12% in the placebo group during the 2nd followup period, and 200 subjects in each treatment group, the study had 88% and 67% to detect a
statistically significant vaccine effect in the pooled Rotarix group and each Rotarix group,
respectively. However, the actual number of evaluable subjects for each group was substantially
lower (<130), as was the observed RV GE attack rate (8.3%). Therefore, VE for this subset was not
sufficiently powered to draw any conclusions.

153

Power Considerations – Secondary Immunogenicity Objective
Assuming seroprotection rates of between 90-98% and an anti-BPT GMT of 27.3 (standard
deviation of 0.332), and assuming that rates/GMTs were the same in vaccine and placebo groups,
175 subjects per group provided the following:
- 80% global power that all the 95% CIs on the decrease in seroprotection rates in the
vaccine group compared to placebo would be below 15%
- 80% global power that the 95% CIs on the fold decrease in anti-BPT in the vaccine group
compared to placebo would be below 1.5
Study Cohorts
Total vaccinated cohorts (TVCs) consisted of all subjects for whom data (safety, efficacy,
immunogenicity) were available, and underwent the following analyses:
- Secondary safety analysis (TVC for safety)
- Secondary immunogenicity analysis if needed (TVC for immunogenicity)
- Secondary efficacy analysis beyond 2 weeks post-Dose 2 (TVC for efficacy)
Criteria for inclusion in the ATP safety cohort were identical to Rota-004. The ATP safety cohort
was to have been used if needed
Criteria for inclusion in the ATP efficacy cohort were identical to Rota-004. The ATP efficacy cohort
was used for the primary efficacy analyses for Year 1, Year 2, and the combined period. It was also
used to analyze the persistence of immune response at the end of the 1st efficacy follow-up period.
The ATP efficacy cohort for the combined follow-up period included all subjects from the 1st Year
ATP efficacy cohort who were enrolled in the 2nd efficacy follow-up period.
Criteria for inclusion in the ATP immunogenicity cohort were identical to Rota-004. In addition,
intervals between Visits 1-2 and Visits 2-3 needed to be 49-83 days. The ATP immunogenicity
cohort was used for the primary immunogenicity analysis.
Final Analyses
The following analyses were performed:
1. Demographics: age and height/weight (mean, range, SD, race, gender, feeding criteria
2. Efficacy:
a. For subjects that received 2 doses
- VE against any and severe RV GE 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to end of 1st efficacy period
- VE against RV GE due to virus types heterologous to vaccine strain from 2 weeks postDose 2 toend of 1st efficacy period
- VE against any and severe pure RV GE 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to end of 1st efficacy
period
- VE against mixed RV GE from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to end of 1st efficacy period
- VE against hospitalization for RV GE 2 weeks post-Dose 2 to end of 1st efficacy period
VE was initially calculated for pooled vaccine groups. If statistical significance favoring the Rotarix
group was reached, then VE of Group C was calculated. If statistical significance was reached
favoring Group C, then VE of Group B was calculated. If statistical significance was reached
favoring Group B, then VE of Group A was calculated. For these analyses, the Cox proportionalhazard model was used to examine underlying assumptions that the period of follow-up was similar
in the treatment groups.
VE by country and for seropositive subjects at study entry were also calculated as exploratory
analyses.
b. For the 2nd efficacy and combined follow-up periods (i.e. 2 weeks post-last dose to end of 2nd
efficacy period)
- VE against any, severe, and hospitalized RV GE
- VE against any, severe, and hospitalized G1 RV GE

154

-

VE against any, severe, and hospitalized RV GE due to heterologous strains

Analyses were performed for pooled vaccine groups and for each group.
3. Immunogenicity:
a. For each antigen at each time point, seropositivity/seroprotection rates and GMCs/GMTs; for
immunogenicity analyses of routine vaccinations, 2-sided 95% CIs for the differences in
seroprotection/seropositivity rates and GMC/GMT ratios between groups were considered
exploratory and clinical limits for non-inferiority were not pre-defined
b. For subjects who received 2 study doses and had both planned blood and stool samples
(N=400), vaccine take 2 months post-Dose 1 and post-Dose 2
RV shedding was evaluated by calculating the percentage of subjects with RV in stool samples
collected at Days 0 and 7 after each study dose and after combined doses.
Anti-RV IgA GMCs were also calculated on subjects who had seroconverted after vaccination or
natural infection.
The impact of feeding on vaccine take (on combined doses) at 2 months post-Dose 2 was explored
using logistic regression. Immunogenicity of Rotarix at both doses, at Dose 1 only, at Dose 2 only,
and for none of the doses were compared between Rotarix groups for the following categories:
breast-fed only, breast-fed + formula-fed, fed within 1 hour before vaccination, and fed within 30
minutes after vaccination. Feeding factors that were significant in the regression were used to
calculate vaccine take.
4. Safety
a. Overall incidence of any AEs (solicited and unsolicited), by group, by dose, for overall
doses, per subject; same calculations for Grade 3 and vaccine-related symptoms;
calculations also done by country
b. Incidence of each solicited general symptom, by group, from Days 0-14, after each dose, for
all doses, per subject; same calculations for Grade 2/3, Grade 3 and vaccine-related
symptoms
c. % of subjects with unsolicited symptoms within Days 0-42 days, by WHO body system/WHO
preferred terms; similar tabulations for Grade 3 and vaccine-related unsolicited symptoms
d. % of subjects and doses reporting unsolicited gastrointestinal symptoms (WHO code 600)
within Days 0-42; similar tabulations for Grade 3 and vaccine-related symptoms
e. Number of SAEs occurring in each efficacy follow-up period; possible vaccine-associated
SAEs, fatal SAEs, and IS cases were described
f. % of subjects who took at least one concomitant medication during the solicited follow-up
period, per group
As an exploratory analysis, pair-wise difference in the incidence of specific symptoms between the
pooled Rotarix and placebo groups was performed using 2-sided Fisher exact test. Pair-wise
differences among the 3 Rotarix groups were also assessed using 2-sided Fisher exact test. The
following endpoints were used for pair-wise analyses:
- Each solicited symptom within Days 0-14 after any study dose
- Each solicited symptom within Days 0-7 after any study dose
- Each solicited Grade 3 symptom within Days 0-7 after any study dose
- Each solicited Grade 2 or 3 symptom within Days 0-7 after any study dose
- Each solicited vaccine-related symptom within Days 0-7after any study dose
Final statistical analysis
A final statistical analysis was performed at the end of the 1st efficacy follow-up period after all
enrolled subjects completed the study visit at the end of the period. Data analyses from the end of
the 1st efficacy follow-up period until the end of the 2nd efficacy follow-up period was presented as
an annex. (Amended September 20, 2002)

155

Interim analysis
Two interim immunogenicity and reactogenicity analyses were performed to provide early
information on dose selection of phase III studies (amended February 12, 2001). No study report
was written, results were strictly controlled, and unblinding at the level of individual data was
restricted to the statistician and database administration.
Two interim efficacy analyses against any and severe RV GE were performed to obtain early
efficacy data (amended July 11, 2002, March 26, 2003). One of these analyses calculated VE at the
end of the 2nd follow-up period in Mexico. Analyses were performed after 70 RV GE episodes
occurred from 2 weeks after Dose 2. No study report was written, results were strictly controlled,
and unblinding at the level of individual data was restricted to the statistician and database
administrator.
In addition, an interim analysis for transplacental anti-RV IgG and transplancental anti-RV
neutralizing antibodies were performed.
Results of all interim analyses were consistent with those presented in study reports.
Additional analyses/changes
Changes made to the planned analyses included the following:
- The TVC was used for analyses instead of the total cohort
- If RV was detected in stool samples from placebo subjects at pre-determined time points, G
type was determined by RT-PCR
- Increase in incidence of specific symptoms post-vaccination between pooled Rotarix groups
versus placebo was explored using 2-sided rather than 1-sided Fisher’s exact test
- VE estimates against pure and mixed RV GE were not calculated because no concurrent
pathogen was identified in the majority of RV GE episodes
- Vaccine take by feeding criteria was not calculated because none of the criteria had a
significant effect in the logistic regression
- For the Year 2 efficacy cohort (ATP, TVC), VE against hospitalized GE was calculated

Protocol deviations – ATP safety cohort 1st follow-up period
The following protocol deviations led to subject exclusion from the ATP safety cohort:
- 38 (Rota 104.7-10, Rota 105.2-11, Rota 105.8-8, placebo-9) received vaccinations forbidden by
the protocol
- 4 (Rota 104.7-1 Rota 105.2-1, Rota 105.8-2, placebo-1) had randomization failure
- 1 (placebo-1) had randomization code broken for SAE
- 96 (Rota 104.7-20, Rota 105.2-27, Rota 105.8-19, placebo-30) received study vaccine not
administered according to protocol (regurgitation within 30 minutes)
- 51 (Rota 104.7-9, Rota 105.2-14, Rota 105.8-18, placebo-10) were either initially positive for RV
or their RV status was unknown on day of Dose 1
Therefore, 1965 subjects were included in the ATP safety cohort.
Protocol deviations – ATP efficacy cohort
The following protocol deviations led to subject exclusion from the ATP efficacy cohort:
- 80 (Rota 104.7-21, Rota 105.2-26, Rota 105.8-22, placeb-11) did not receive Dose 2
- 10 (Rota 104.7-3, Rota 105.8-3, placebo-4) dropped out before 1st efficacy period
- 29 (Rota 104.7-7, Rota 105.2-1, Rota 105.8-4, placebo-17) had GE stool samples collected
between Visit 1 to 2 that were positive for RV other than vaccine strain
Therefore, 1846 subjects were included in the ATP efficacy cohort.
Protocol deviations – ATP immunogenicity cohort
The following protocol deviations led to subject exclusion from the ATP immunogenicity cohort:
- 101 (Rota 104.7-22, Rota 105.2-27, Rota 105.8-24, placebo-28) received medication forbidden
in the protocol
- 45 (Rota 104.7-7, Rota 105.2-8, Rota 105.8-5, placebo-25) had GE stool samples collected
between Visits 1-3 that were positive for RV other than vaccine strain
- 88 (Rota 104.7-18, Rota 105.2-21, Rota 105.8-26, placebo-23) were non-complaint with
vaccination schedule (Dose 2 received outside of 49-83 day interval between vaccinations)
- 58 (Rota 104.7-19, Rota 105.2-9, Rota 105.8-15, placebo-15) were non-complaint with blood
sampling schedule
- 147 (Rota 104.7-38, Rota 105.2-45, Rota 105.8-42, placebo-22) had missing immunogenicity
data
Therefore, 1526 subjects were included in the ATP immunogenicity cohort.

Study demographics – ATP efficacy cohort (N=1846)
The median age at Dose 1 (8 weeks) was the same between groups. Most of the subjects in either
group were either classified as Other or White/Caucasian. Female-to-male ratios were
approximately 1:1 in the 105.2 and placebo groups and 0.8:1 in the 104.7and 105.8 groups. Median
height and weight measurements were also the same or similar between groups.

Concomitant vaccinations – TVC
Over 98% of subjects in each group received DTPw-HB+Hib vaccine with Dose 1 and Dose 2 of
Rotarix/placebo.
Concomitant vaccinations – ATP immunogenicity cohort
Over 98% of subjects in each group received DTPw-HB+Hib with Dose 1 and Dose 2 of
Rotarix/placebo. No subject was co-administered OPV. Of the subjects with available routine
vaccination serology results at Visit 3, over 93% in each group received 2 doses of DTPw-HB+Hib
and OPV vaccines between Visit 1 and before Visit 3.
Efficacy for 2-dose regimen – 2nd Efficacy Follow-up Period (Year 2)

Protocol deviations – ATP efficacy cohort for Year 2
The following protocol deviations led to subject exclusion from the ATP efficacy cohort:
- 9 (Rota 104.7-2, Rota 105.2-3, Rota 105.8-3, placebo-1) received vaccinations forbidden by the
protocol
- 32 (Rota 104.7-4, Rota 105.2-14, Rota 105.8-5, placebo-9) received study vaccine not
administered according to protocol (regurgitation of dose within 30 minutes)
- 27 (Rota 104.7-4, Rota 105.2-7, Rota 105.8-12, placebo-4) were either initially positive for RV
or their RV status was unknown on day of Dose 1
- 1 (Rota 104.7-1) did not receive Dose 2
- 11 (Rota 104.7-2, Rota 105.2-0, Rota 105.8-1, placebo-8) had GE stool samples collected
between Visit 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2 that were positive for RV other than vaccine strain
Therefore, 441 subjects were included in the ATP efficacy cohort for Year 2 and combined periods.
Study demographics – ATP efficacy cohort (N=441)
The median age at Dose 1 (8 weeks) was the same between groups. Most of the subjects in either
group were either classified as Other or White/Caucasian. Female-to-male ratios varied between
groups. Median height and weight measurements were the same or similar between groups.

Year 1 Efficacy (2 weeks post-Dose 2 to Year 1 of age) – ATP efficacy cohort (2-dose cohort)
Reviewer Note: The median duration of follow-up during the Year 1 efficacy period was
approximately 7 months in each group.
Summary of reported any RV GE and severe RV GE episodes – Year 1
RV was detected by ELISA in 58 Rotarix recipients (104.7-21, 105.2-22,105.8-15) and 49 placebo
recipients. No subject in any Rotarix group had more than one RV GE episode, while 2 subjects
each had 2 RV GE episodes (one subject – 2 G1 wt episodes; one subject – 1 G1 wt episode and 1
G9 episode).

Mixed infections – Year 1
Three Rotarix recipients and 3 placebo recipients had mixed RV GE episodes. One episode
(104.7group) was associated with salmonella, two episode (105.8-1, placebo-1) were associated with
shigella, one episode (placebo group) was associated with Enteropathogenic E. Coli, and two
episodes (105.8group-1, placebo-1) were associated with Enteroaggressive E coli, (104.7group).
Clinical characteristics of RV GE episodes – Year 1
The duration of looser than normal stools and vomiting were shorter in the Rotarix groups
compared to the placebo group. The frequencies of fever ≥ 39.0°C, dehydration ≥6%, and
hospitalizations were also less in the Rotarix groups compared to placebo. Nine Rotarix (104.7-5,
105.2-1,105.8-3) and 14 placebo recipients required hospitalization.
Anti-RV IgA status at Visit 3 versus RV GE occurrence during Year 1, Rotarix groups
The percentages of subjects in the Rotarix group that reported at least one RV GE during the 1st
efficacy follow-up period, by anti-RV IgA seropositive status at Visit 3, are included in the table
below for each Rotarix group and for the groups pooled together. In each group, there were less
seropositive subjects who had an RV GE episode than seronegative subjects.

VE against any RV GE – Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2
VE of Rotarix against any (non-vaccine strain) RV GE during this interval was 70.2% (95% CI: 23.090.2%) for the 105.2 group, 70.2% (95% CI: 23.0-90.2%) for the 105.8 group, and 63.5% (95% CI:
29.5-81.0%) for the pooled group.
VE against severe RV GE – Dose 1 to 2 weeks post-Dose 2
VE of Rotarix against (non-vaccine strain) severe RV GE during this interval was 80.1% (95% CI:
6.7-97.9%) for the 105.2 group, 90.1% (95% CI: 30.1-99.8%) for the 105.8 group, and 73.4% (95% CI:

Vaccine virus shedding
The percentages of Rotarix recipients who shed vaccine RV in stools between Day 6 to Day 10
after Dose 1 were 36.2% for the 104.7 group, 35.2% for the 105.2 group, and 44.1% for the 105.8
group. The percentages of Rotarix recipients who shed vaccine RV in stools between Day 6 to Day
10 after Dose 2 were 11.5% for the 104.7 group, 21.3% for the 105.2 group, and 16.5% for the 105.8
group. Only one subject shed vaccine virus beyond Day 10 after either dose (105.8 group,
approximately 2 months post-Dose 1).
Reviewer Note: Table 31 on page 128 indicates that 1 placebo recipient shed vaccine virus in stool
collected between Day 6 to Day 10 post-Dose 2. However, on page 127, the applicant states that
“None of the placebo recipients in the ATP immunogenicity cohort shed RV, except one subject
who shed wild-type G2 RV.”
The percentages of Rotarix recipients who shed vaccine RV in at least one stool for at least one
time point were 38.1% for the 104.7 group, 45.2% for the 105.2 group, and 47.8% for the 105.8 group.
Vaccine take
Vaccine take rate after Dose 1 and Dose 2 was higher in the 105.8 group than other groups,
although 95% CIs were overlapping.

Comment: *RV in stools collected at pre-determined time points or vaccine virus in stools collected in case of GE episode
Source: Study Report Body Rota-006, pg 129

Vaccine take rate after any dose was also higher in the 105.8 group (75.5%) than the other groups
(104.7group – 64.5%, 105.2 group-72.5%, placebo-4%).

168

Reviewer Note: In the table above, the N for vaccine take after Dose 1 and Dose are described as
“… or with vaccine virus in stools collected after Visit 1 to Visit 2” and “…or with vaccine virus in
stools collected after Visit 2 to Visit 3,” respectively. This appears to be an error, as each N should
include the number of subjects with available stool results during these visit intervals.
Impact of feeding on vaccine take rates
Vaccine take rates by feeding criteria were not calculated because none of the pre-defined feeding
criteria (exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding + formula feeding, feeding within 1 hour before
vaccination, feeding within 30 minutes after vaccination) had a significant effect on vaccine take at 2
months post-Dose 2.
Year 1 Immunogenicity (Visit 3 to Year 1 of age) – ATP immunogenicity cohort, routine vaccination
subset (2-dose cohort)
Immunogenicity analyses of routine vaccination were performed on the subset of subjects with
documented receipt of at least 2 doses of routine vaccines between Visit 1 and the end of Year 1.
Among subjects with available routine vaccination serology results at Visit 3, over 93% in each
group received 2 doses of DTPw-HIB+Hib and OPV between Visit 1 and before Visit 3.
Anti-diphtheria antibody response
Seroprotection rates against diphtheria at Visit 3 and the end of Year 1 appeared similar between
the 105.8 group and placebo group. GMCs were also similar between groups in all groups at both
time points.

ELISA results for GE stool samples were not available for 26.7% of GE episodes. Results were
unavailable mainly because stool samples were not collected.
Anti-RV IgA status at the end of Year 1 vs. RV GE occurrence during Year 2, Rotarix groups
The percentages of subjects in the Rotarix group that reported at least one RV GE during the 2nd
efficacy follow-up period, by anti-RV IgA seropositive status at the end of the 1st efficacy period, are
included in the table below for each Rotarix group and for the groups pooled together. In each
group except the 104.7group, there were less seropositive subjects who had an RV GE episode than
seronegative subjects.

Year 2 Efficacy (end of 1st efficacy period to final visit at the end of 2nd efficacy period) – TVC for
efficacy subset Year 2 (2-dose cohort)
Of the 521 subjects in the TVC, 4 were not included in the TVC for efficacy cohort Year 2 (3 did not
receive Dose 2, 1 did not enter the 2nd efficacy follow-up period). Therefore, a total of 517 subjects
(104.7-127, 105.2-125, 105.8-134, placebo-131) were included in this cohort. The median duration of
follow-up was approximately 10 months for each group.

ELISA results for GE stool samples were not available for 27.2% of GE episodes. Percentages
were similar between groups. Results were unavailable mainly because stools were not collected.
Anti-RV IgA status at the end of Year 1 versus RV GE occurrence during Year 2 - Rotarix groups
Similar to results in the ATP efficacy cohort Year 2, in each group except the 104.7group, there were
less seropositive subjects at the end of Year 1 who had an RV GE episode during Year 2 than
seronegative subjects.

VE against hospitalization due to RV GE – Combined period
VE against hospitalized RV GE did not reach statistical significance in any of the Rotarix groups;
only three hospitalizations occurred (104.7group-1, 105.8group-1, placebo-1).
VE against hospitalization due to GE – Combined period
VE estimates against GE of any etiology requiring hospitalization did not reach statistical
significance for any of the Rotarix groups.
Combined Efficacy (Dose 1 to final visit at the end of 2nd efficacy period) – TVC (2-dose cohort)
VE against any RV GE – Dose 1 to end of Year 2
VE estimates against any RV GE (other than vaccine strain) reached statistical significance for the
104.7group (60.5%), 105.2 group (59.6%), and the pooled Rotarix group (52.4%). Although there were
fewer subjects in the 105.8 group compared to placebo who reported any RV GE, VE estimate did
not reach statistical significance.

Solicited general AEs – Days 0-14 post-dose
In general, the incidence of any, Grade 2/3, Grade 3, and vaccine-related AEs for each symptom
after Dose 1 were similar between the 3 Rotarix groups. There appeared to be slightly higher rates
of any diarrhea (8.1%) in the 105.8 group compared to other groups. Rates of any cough/runny nose,
irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite, fever, and vomiting each exceeded 10% in each Rotarix group.
The incidence of Grade 3 AEs was relatively low compared to the total number of AEs for each
symptom. Grade 3 irritability/fussiness was reported at a rate ≥ 10% in each of the 3 Rotarix groups.
Grade 3 AEs that were reported at a rate ≥ 1% and < 10% in each of the 3 Rotarix groups were
cough/runny nose, diarrhea, loss of appetite, fever, and vomiting.

Overall, the incidence of total, Grade 2/3, Grade 3, and vaccine-related AEs for each symptom after
Dose 2 were similar between the 3 Rotarix groups. There appeared to be slightly higher rates of
any (8.5%) diarrhea in the 105.8 group compared to other groups. The incidence of Grade 3 AEs
was relatively low compared to the total number of AEs for each symptom. In general, the rates of
AEs after Dose 2 were similar to those after Dose 1. Rates of any cough/runny nose,
irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite, fever, and vomiting each exceeded 10% in each Rotarix group.
The incidence of Grade 3 AEs was relatively low compared to the total number of AEs for each
symptom. Grade 3 symptoms reported at a rate ≥ 10% were cough runny nose (all Rotarix groups)
and irritability/fussiness (104.7group). Grade 3 AEs that were reported at ≥ 1% and < 10% were
diarrhea (all Rotarix groups), loss of appetite (104.7group and 105.2group), fever (all Rotarix groups),
and vomiting (all Rotarix groups). Grade 3 loss of appetite in the 105.8group was reported at <1%.

The incidence of doses or subjects reporting any, Grade 2/3, Grade 3, and vaccine-related AEs for
each symptom after any dose were similar between the pooled Rotarix group and placebo.
For each solicited symptom after any dose, statistical analyses showed that the percentages of
subjects reporting any symptom, Grade 2/3 symptom, Grade 3 symptom or vaccine-related
symptom were not significantly different between any of the Rotarix groups or between the pooled
Rotarix group and placebo.
There was no noticeable peak day in the prevalence of diarrhea from Day 0 to Day 14 after either
dose for either group. A peak in the prevalence of fever occurred at Day 0 post-Dose 1 and postDose 2 for all groups. A peak in the prevalence of vomiting occurred at Day 1 post-Dose 1 and
post-Dose 2. The median duration of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever during the 15-day period after
each dose were similar between groups. Durations of each symptom after Dose 1 were also similar
to those after Dose 2.

186

Solicited general AEs – Days 0-3, Days 0-7 post-dose
The applicant stated that the incidence of each individual symptom from Day 0-3 and Day 0-7 postvaccination were similar between groups, with the majority of symptoms occurring within 8 days
post-vaccination.
For each solicited symptom after any dose, statistical analyses demonstrated that the percentages
of subjects reporting any symptom, Grade 2/3 symptom, Grade 3 symptom or vaccine-related
symptom during Days 0-7 or Days 0-14 post-vaccination were not significantly different between
any of the Rotarix groups or between the pooled Rotarix group and placebo. The only exception
was Grade 2/3 vomiting During Day 0-7 post-vaccination, which occurred significantly more in the
105.2 group compared to the 104.7 group (12.4% vs. 8.4%; p=0.036). However, differences in rates of
Grade 3 vomiting were not statistically significant.
Unsolicited AEs – Days 0-42 post-dose
The percentages of subjects with at least one unsolicited AE of any kind were similar between
groups (104.7-65.1%, 105.2-65.6%, 105.8-60.7%, placebo-63.7%). The percentages of subjects in
each Preferred Term also appeared similar between groups.
In the Rotarix groups, AE PTs reported in ≥ 10% of subjects were viral infection (all groups), and
pharyngitis (all groups). AE PTs reported in ≥ 1% and <10% of Rotarix subjects were contact
dermatitis (105.2 group), allergy (105.2 and 105.8groups), fever (all groups), abdominal pain (all
groups), anorexia, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux (105.2 and 105.8groups), vomiting (all
groups), nervousness (all groups), infection (all groups), moniliasis (104.7 and 105.2groups), otitis
media (105.2 group), upper respiratory infection (all groups), bronchitis (all groups), bronchospasm
(all groups), coughing (all groups), pneumonia (all groups), respiratory disorder (105.2 group), rhinitis
(all groups), skin disorder (all groups), and conjunctivitis (all groups).
The percentages of subjects with at least one unsolicited Grade 3 AE were also similar between
groups (104.7-2.8%, 105.2-5%, 105.8-2.6%, placebo-3.2%). There were no major differences between
groups for any WHO Preferred Term. Only Grade 3 PT pneumonia was reported in ≥ 1% of subjects
in the Rotarix groups (105.2-1.5%, 105.8-1.1%
Only 6 subjects, all from Brazil, reported a vaccine-related AE (104.7-2, placebo-4). One of the
Rotarix recipients had Fever, while the other had Bronchitis.
The percentages of subjects with at least one unsolicited gastrointestinal AE (7.1-7.7% in each
group), one vaccine-related GI AE (0.3-0.9% in each group) and one Grade 3 GI AE (0% in each
group) were similar between groups. None of the gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed as
vaccine-related.
Reactogenicity by country – Days 0-14 (solicited/unsolicited AEs), Days 0-42 (unsolicited
AEs) post-dose
Overall, rates of solicited and unsolicited symptoms during these intervals after each dose were
similar between groups for each country.
Concomitant medications/vaccinations – Days 0-14 post-dose
The percentages of subjects who started taking any medication and any antipyretics after each
dose were comparable between groups. No increases in medication utilization occurred from Dose
1 to Dose 2. The percentages of subjects who took medications from Visit 1 to the end of Year 1
were also similar between groups.
SAEs – Dose 1 to end of Year 1
The numbers of subjects with at least one SAE were similar between groups (104.7-52, 105.2-55,
105.8-49, placebo-64). All SAEs were assessed as unrelated to study vaccination. The distributions
of SAEs by WHO Body System or WHO Preferred Term were not provided in the report.
Reviewer Note: The reviewer did not observe a noticeable difference in distributions of SAEs by
WHO Preferred Term. In the Rotarix groups, no SAE PTs were reported at a rate ≥ 10%, while

187

SAEs that occurred at ≥ 1% and <10% was bronchitis (104.7 -1.3%, 105.2 -1.3%), gastroenteritis
(104.7 -4.1%, 105.2 -3.7%, 105.8 -3.7%), pneumonia (104.7 -3.7%, 105.2 -5.7%, 105.8 -3.9%). None of
the SAEs were as related to Rotarix vaccination.
One routine vaccine-related SAE (bronchitis) occurred in a Rotarix recipient (104.7group) from Brazil
beginning on Day 0 post-Dose 2 of DTPw-HB+Hib vaccine. Treatment code was not broken.
One vaccine-unrelated IS case (104.7group) occurred 6 months post-Dose 2 in a 10-month male
from Mexico. The subject recovered completely.
One subject, a 13 month-old male from Brazil, was diagnosed with Kawasaki’s disease with onset
approximately 7 months post-Dose 2 of Rotarix (104.7group).
Deaths – Dose 1 to end of Year 1
Three subjects died due to vaccine-unrelated SAEs. The first, a Mexican boy, died 13 days postDose 1 of placebo following cardio-respiratory failure. Treatment code for this subject was broken.
The second, a Brazilian boy (104.7group), died 3 months post-Dose 2 from septicemia. The
treatment code was not broken. The third, a Mexican boy (105.8group), died 1 month post-Dose 2
from a road traffic accident. The treatment code was not broken.
SAEs and non-serious AEs leading to drop-out at end of Year 1
Three subjects (Rota 104.7-1, Rota 105.8-1, placebo-1) dropped out due to SAEs (all deaths – see
section above).
Six subjects (Rota 105.2-2, Rota 105.8-2, placebo-2) dropped out due to non-SAEs. One of these subjects
(placebo) withdrew due to a Grade 2 allergic reaction starting 1 day post-Dose 1 that was assessed as
possibly related to vaccination. The other 5 subjects dropped out due to non-vaccine-related AEs as
follows: severe gastrointestinal reflux post-Dose 2 (105.8group), severe anemia 254 days post-Dose 2
(105.8group), severe reaction to BCG vaccination post-Dose 1 (placebo), Grade 1 hypothyroidism 108
days post-Dose 2 (105.2group), and Grade 2 cervical lymphangioma 117 days post-Dose 1 (105.2group).
Year 1 Safety – ATP cohort for safety (2-dose subset)
Note: Safety analyses on the ATP safety cohort were performed because more than 5% of subjects
were eliminated from this cohort. The ATP safety cohort consisted of 1965 subjects (104.7-499,
105.2-487, 105.8-493, placebo-486) in the 2-dose subset.
Overall incidence of AEs, Grade 3 AEs, and vaccine-related AEs, solicited or unsolicited –
Days 0-14 post-dose
The percentages of subjects, who reported at least one AE, one Grade 3 AE, and one vaccinerelated AE after Dose 1, Dose 2, and either dose, were similar between groups. An increase in
symptoms from Dose 1 to Dose 2 was not observed for any group.
Solicited general AEs – Days 0-14 post-dose
Overall, the incidence of total, Grade 2/3, Grade 3, and vaccine-related AEs for each symptom after
each dose were similar between the groups. The incidence of Grade 3 AEs was relatively low
compared to the total number of AEs for each symptom.
Unsolicited AEs – Days 0-42 post-dose
The percentages of subjects with at least one unsolicited AE of any kind were similar between
groups. Results of other analyses were consistent with those for the TVC.
Year 2 safety – TVC (2-dose subset)

8.1.4.3 Comments & Conclusions
In Rota-006, two doses of Rotarix at a slightly higher concentration of vaccine virus (105.8 ffu of
RIX4414) than that used in the 2 pivotal trials (Rota-023 and Rota-036), administered to children 6
to 12 weeks 2 months apart, resulted in an efficacy of 70% against any RV GE detected by ELISA
during the 1st efficacy follow-up period, although the LL of the 95% CI was 45.7%. VE against
severe RV GE during this period was 85.6%. VE estimates against any RV GE and severe RV GE
detected by ELISA during the 2nd efficacy period did not reach statistical significance, possibly due
to the smaller sample size and lower than expected RV GE attack rate during this period. Over the
combined follow-up period, VE against severe RV GE was 92.6%.
Statistically significant VE against any RV GE and severe RV GE during Year 1 was observed for
Rotarix at lower viral concentrations. In the 104.7 group, VE against any and severe RV GE was
58.4% and 65.8%, respectively, although LLs of the 95% CI for both estimates were low. In the 105.2
group, VE against any and severe RV GE was 55.7% and 71.0%, respectively. These VE estimates
in both groups were lower than in the 105.8 group, with LLs of the 95% CI less than 50%. In the 104.7
group, VE estimates against any RV GE (62.4%) and severe RV GE (78.3%) during the combined
period reached statistical significance, although the LLs of the 95% CI were less than 50%.
For all three groups, VE estimates against any wild-type G1 RV GE during Year 1 were statistically
significant (104.7 - 59.5%, 105.2 – 79.6%, 105.8 – 76.4%), although LLs of the 95% CIs for all 3
estimates were less than 50%. VE estimates against any G9 RV GE did not reach statistical
significance for any group, while VE against G2, G3, or G4 types were not calculated individually
due to limited numbers of cases. When any non-G1 RV GE episodes were pooled together, VE was
60.9% for the 105.8 group, although the lower 95% CI limit was only 7.2%.
VE estimates against severe wild-type G1 RV GE during year 1 were statistically significant for the
105.2 group (75.3%) and 105.8 group (87.8%); LLs of the 95% CI were below 50% for both estimates.

189

VE against severe G9 RV GE was also statistically significant for the 104.7 and 105.8 groups (70.2%
and 77.4%, respectively; LLs of the 95% CI ≤ 50% for both). VE against pooled severe non-G1 RV
GE reached statistically significance for all groups (104.7 - 71.5%, 105.2 – 65.2%, 105.8 – 82.7%); LLs
of the 95% CI were all below 50%.
During Year 2, statistically significant VE was not observed against any wild-type G1 RV GE and
severe G1 RV GE, or for any or severe pooled non-G1 RV GE. Over the combined period,
statistically significant VE against any wild-type G1 RV GE was observed for the 104.7 group
(77.6%), while statistically significant VE against severe wild-type G1 RV GE was observed for the
104.7 (81.2%) and the 105.8 group (90.4%). All of these estimates were associated with LLs of the
95% CI less than 50%. VE estimates for any and severe pooled non-G1 RV GE did not reach
statistical significance for either period.
Rotarix was efficacious during Year 1 against RV GE hospitalization in the 105.8 group (79%; LL of
95% CI: 24.9%) and 105.2 group (93.0%).
Analyses of immune responses to routine childhood vaccinations demonstrated that there were no
significant differences between treatment groups in seroprotection rates, seropositivity rates, or
GMC/GMTs to any of the vaccine antigens that did not favor any of the Rotarix groups. Although
there appeared to be no impact of Rotarix at any concentration on the immune responses to routine
co-administered and separately administered vaccine antigens, clinical limits for non-inferiority of
Rotarix compared to placebo were not pre-defined for this study.
Safety was also demonstrated throughout the trial. No deaths were seen throughout the study.
SAEs were relatively infrequent, and distributions by WHO Preferred Term were not noticeably
different between groups. None of the SAEs were assessed as related to Rotarix/placebo
vaccination. Only 1 case of IS was observed, occurring in a Rotarix recipient (104.7group) 6 months
post-Dose 2.
Overall rates of subjects who experienced any solicited/unsolicited AE, Grade 2/3 AEs, Grade 3
AEs, or vaccine-related AEs from Day 0 to Day 14 post-dose were similar between treatment
groups. Increases in symptoms between Dose 1 and Dose 2 were not observed. Rates for each
solicited symptom were not significantly different between groups. The percentages of subjects with
at least one unsolicited AE from Day 0 to Day 42 post-dose were similar between groups. The
percentages of subjects with at least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE was less in the Rotarix group
compared to the placebo group. Overall, there were no noticeable differences between groups for
any unsolicited AE by WHO Preferred Term.
The validity of the results was strengthened by the double-blinded, placebo-controlled, study
design. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity endpoints, case definitions, and study cohorts were
clearly defined and appropriate. Overall, the study was well-conducted without any noticeable
sources of biases. Data quality was acceptable, and appropriate data analyses were conducted as
stated in the protocol and amendments. Protocol deviations were balanced between groups.
Subject dropouts and missing data were handled appropriately and according to protocol.
Results from Rota-006 support the use of Rotarix in the prevention of any and RV GE. Efficacy data
supports the use of Rotarix in the prevention of any and severe RV GE caused by G1 wild-type
strains and severe G9 RV GE during Year 1, although LLs of the 95% CIs were all less than 50%.
Except for G9, VE against other individual serotypes could not be adequately assessed due to
limited GE cases caused by each non-G1 serotype. When non-G1 types were pooled together,
efficacy against any and severe RV GE during Year 1 was demonstrated, although LLs of the 95%
CIs for these estimates were low.

Methods

Four studies that contained efficacy data were reviewed: Rota-004, Rota-006, Rota-023, and Rota036. Rota-023 and Rota-036 were pivotal Phase III studies that evaluated VE of two doses of
Rotarix at 106.5 CCID50 per dose, the potency intended for licensure. Doses in both studies were
administered either 1 or 2 months apart. In Rota-023, 17,867 infants 6-13 weeks of age from 11
Latin American countries were included in the Year 1 ATP efficacy cohort (see table below). In
Rota-036, 3874 infants 6 to 14 weeks of age from 6 European countries were included in the Year 1
ATP efficacy cohort. Rota-004 and Rota-006 were Phase IIb studies conducted in infants 6-12
weeks of age that provided supportive efficacy data. Rota-004 evaluated two doses of Rotarix at
105.3 CCID50 per dose, administered 2 months apart. Rota-006 evaluated two doses of Rotarix at 3
different potencies (105.3 CCID50, 105.6 CCID50, and 106.6 CCID50 per dose), administered 2 months
apart. In addition, Rota-006 evaluated VE of three doses of Rotarix at each of the three potencies in
subset of subjects. All four studies also evaluated anti-RV IgA immunogenicity of Rotarix in a subset
of subjects. For further details of each study, please refer to sections 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3, and 8.1.4

General Discussion of Efficacy Endpoints

Primary and secondary RV-related efficacy endpoints for each study are listed in the table below. In
Rota-006 and Rota-036, the primary endpoint was the occurrence of any wild-type RV GE during the
Year 1 efficacy period (i.e. 1st efficacy follow-up period). In Rota-023, the primary endpoint was the
occurrence of severe wild-type RV GE during the Year 1 efficacy period. In Rota-004, primary
endpoints included the occurrence of any and severe wild-type RV GE during the Year 1 efficacy
period. Year 1 efficacy period for Rota-006 and Rota-023 was defined as the time from 2 weeks postDose 2 until 1 year of age. Year 1 efficacy period for Rota-004 and Rota-036 was defined as the time
from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until the end of the 1st RV season. In Rota-004, the 1st RV season covered
December 1, 2000 to June 1, 2001. In Rota-036, the RV season covered the beginning of December
2004 to the end of May 2005.

191

Secondary endpoints common to Rota-004, Rota-006, and Rota-036 included severe RV GE during
Year 1, any and severe RV GE due to heterologous types (i.e. G1 and non-G1) during Year 1,
severe RV GE during Year 2, and any and severe RV GE during the combined period. Additional
endpoints common to Rota-006 and Rota-036 included RV GE hospitalization during Year 1 and
any RV GE during Year 2. Other endpoints specific to each study are noted in the table below.
Secondary endpoints for Rota-023 only involved severe RV GE: severe wild-type G1 RV GE during
all 3 study periods, severe non-G1 RV GE during Year 1, and severe RV GE (all wild-type, wild G1,
non-G1) from Dose 1 to the end of Year 1.
For secondary endpoints in Rota-004 and Rota-023, the Year 2 efficacy period was defined as the
time from end of Year 1 until 2 years of age, while the combined period was the time from 2 weeks
post-Dose 2 until 2 years of age. In Rota-006 and Rota-036, the Year 2 efficacy period went from
the end of Year 1 until the end of the 2nd RV season, with the combined period extending from 2
weeks post-Dose 2 until the end of the 2nd RV season.

The choice of primary endpoints for all studies was appropriate because of the large burden of RV
GE during the first year of life, and because the disease burden of severe RV disease (i.e. diarrhea
and dehydration) is highest between 5-11 months of age. These endpoints therefore provided
reasonable assessments of primary clinical benefit. Secondary endpoints were also appropriately
chosen because they allowed assessment of cross-protection against other circulating heterologous
serotypes, many of which had G and/or P components similar to those in the vaccine. Endpoints
measured during Year 2 allowed the assessment of persistence of vaccine protection during a
period when children remain susceptible to any and severe RV disease. In addition, an early Phase
II placebo-controlled trial involving 2 doses of uncloned 89-12 RV strain (developed by Avant
immunotherapeutics) used endpoints of any RV GE and very severe RV GE (Vesikari score >14
points) during Year 1, Year 2, and the 2-year combined period after vaccination.
In all studies, any RV GE and severe RV GE were accurately identified and reported using welldefined case definitions. Definitions for diarrhea and vomiting were identical in all studies. The
definition of GE was diarrhea in Rota-004 and diarrhea with or without vomiting in Rota-006, Rota-

192

023, and Rota-036. The definition of RV GE (an episode of GE in which RV other than vaccine
strain is identified in a stool sample collected no later than 7 days after GE symptom onset) was
identical in Rota-004, Rota-006, and Rota-036. In Rota-023, the primary endpoint definition of
severe RV GE was an episode of RV GE requiring hospitalization and/or re-hydration therapy
(equivalent to WHO plan B or C) in a medical facility. In all studies, including Rota-023 (secondary
endpoint), severe RV GE was defined as an episode of RV GE with a Vesikari score ≥ 11 points.
The Vesikari 20-point scale, which has been accepted internationally and widely used, measures
the following: intensity/frequency and duration of diarrhea and vomiting, degree of fever and
dehydration, and type of treatment. This scale, unlike the Clark scale used in the RotaTeq (Merck)
development program, takes into account both the degree of dehydration and type of treatment.
Rota-004, Rota-006, and Rota-036 conducted active follow-up of subjects for GE case
ascertainment. In Rota-004, subjects were contacted every 2 weeks by telephone from 2 weeks
post-Dose 2 until the end of Year 2. In Rota-006, subjects were visited weekly by study personnel
from 1 week post-Dose 1 until the end of Year 2. In Rota-036, subjects were contacted weekly from
1 week post-Dose 1 until the end of Year 1 (i.e. end of the 1st RV season), every two weeks from
the end of Year 1 until the beginning of the Year 2 RV season and weekly from the beginning of the
Year 2 RV season until the end of Year 2. Rota-23 conducted GE ascertainment by contacting
hospitals and other medical facilities in the study area at least twice a week. Subjects were also
contacted or visited at least every 4 days by non-medical study personnel to identify severe cases
not identified by medical facility surveillance, such as cases treated in facilities outside the
surveillance system.
Individual GE diary cards were used in each study to collect daily temperature, stool and emesis data
for each GE episode. Parents were also instructed in the collection, labeling, storage, and submission
of stool samples for each GE episode. All collected stools were laboratory tested for the presence of
RV by ELISA. ELISA testing was performed at the laboratory of Dr. R. Ward, Children’s Hospital
Medical Center, Cincinnati (Rota-004, Rota-006) or at GSK’s laboratory in Belgium using a commercial
ELISA kit “RotaClone” (Rota-023, Rota-036). Stools that tested positive for RV by ELISA were further
analyzed for G and P type determination by RT-PCR followed by Reverse Hybridization assay (or
optional sequencing) at Delft Diagnostic Laboratory, the Netherlands (Rota-023, Rota-036), or by RTPCR followed by ------------------- (or optional sequencing) at the Laboratory of ----------------Finland (Rota-004) or at GSK laboratory, Belgium (Rota-006). The Reverse Hybridization assay was
also able to differentiate G1 vaccine virus from wild-type G1 RV. G1 type detected by RT-PCR was
sequenced to differentiate G1 vaccine virus from wild-type G1 RV if the stool sample was collected up
to 2 weeks post-Dose 2 (Rota-004) or 2 months post-Dose 2 (Rota-006).
In all studies, serum anti-RV IgA response, considered a standard measure of immunity in most
field studies and vaccine trials, was measured at pre- and post-vaccination time points (1-2 months
post-Dose 2, end of Year 1) in a subset of subjects using well-defined parameters. Anti-RV IgA
responses were measured in Rota-004 and Rota-006 by ELISA at the laboratory of Dr. R. Ward
(Cincinnati), and in Rota-23 and Rota-036 using the GSK ELISA in Belgium. Based on results of
retesting of available samples from Rota-004, Rota-006, and a third BLA study (Rota-033) with the
GSK ELISA, an agreement of 98.5% was demonstrated between both ELISA methods. However,
seroconversion rates were higher with GSK ELISA due to increased sensitivity of the GSK assay.
Seropositivity was defined as an anti-RV IgA antibody concentration ≥ 20 U/mL. Seroconversion
was defined as an anti-RV IgA antibody concentration ≥ 20 U/mL in a subject who was
seronegative for RV pre-Dose 1. The cut-off value of ≥ 20 U/mL has been previously used as
evidence of natural RV infection49. For both the ATP and TVC immunogenicity cohorts,
seroconversion rates and GMC values were obtained at each specified time point.
In Rota-006, RV immunogenicity was also measured by vaccine take, which was defined as antiRV IgA seropositivity in any post-vaccination blood sample or detection of RV antigen by ELISA in
any post-vaccination stool sample (including GE stool sample) in a previously RV-uninfected
subject. Stool antigen ELISA testing was performed at the laboratory of Dr. Ward (Cincinnati). Any
RV detected in stools from GE episodes was further typed at GSK’s laboratory (Belgium), and any

193

G1 RV was sequenced to differentiate vaccine virus from wild-type strains. Vaccine take rates were
calculated after each dose. Vaccine take was included as an immunogenicity parameter because in
some cases, serum IgA antibodies are not detected post-vaccination despite evidence of RV
shedding (and hence viral replication) in stools several days after vaccination. In studies of
RotaShield, the oral rhesus-human reassortant RV vaccine, a similar method of measuring vaccine
take was utilized, except that stool IgA was also included51.
9.1.3

Study Design

Adequate and well controlled studies
All four studies were adequately conducted in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
manner. A randomization blocking scheme ensured that balance between treatment groups was
maintained. The control vaccine had the same composition and appearance as Rotarix except that
it did not contain vaccine virus. Prospectively identified endpoints and statistical analysis plans were
not significantly amended ad-hoc. These study design characteristics resulted in minimal biases as
reflected by lack of major imbalances in baseline characteristics between treatment groups or lack
of questionable endpoint analytic results.
Assessment of benefit
Adequacy of duration of follow-up
As previously mentioned in section 9.1.2, the duration of follow-up for primary and secondary
efficacy endpoints in all the trials were adequate and provided reasonable assessments of primary
and secondary clinical benefits of vaccine protection.
Entry criteria
For inclusion into any of the studies, parental/guardian written informed consent was required, and
the subject was required to be free of obvious health problems as established by pre-enrollment
medical history and clinical examination. Rota-023 and Rota-036 also required that
parents/guardians were able to comply with study procedures. The required age ranges at Dose 1
were the same or similar between studies: 6-12 weeks (Rota-004, Rota-006, Rota-023 except
Chile), 6-13 weeks (Rota-023, Chile only), and 6-14 weeks (Rota-036). Additional inclusion criteria
consisted of birth between 36-42 weeks gestation (Rota-004, Rota-006) and birth weight > 2000
grams (Rota-006, Rota-036).
The following exclusion criteria were common to all 4 studies:
- Any clinically significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease or other serious medical
condition as determined by the investigator
- Any immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including HIV infection
- Chronic administration (>14 days) of immunosuppressive or other immune-modifying drugs
since birth
- Use of any investigational or non-registered drug/vaccine other than study vaccine within 30
days before study vaccine/placebo, or planned use during study period
- History of allergic disease/reaction likely to be exacerbated by any vaccine component
- Administration of immunoglobulins/blood products since birth or planned administration during
study period
The following exclusion criteria were common to Rota-004, Rota-006, and Rota-036:
- Planned administration of a vaccine (including routine pediatric vaccines) not foreseen by the
study protocol within 14 days before and after any study dose]
- GE within 7 days before Dose 1 (warranted deferral of vaccination)
- Acute disease at the time of enrollment, i.e. moderate/severe illness with or without fever
(warranted deferral of vaccination)
The following exclusion criteria were common to Rota-004 and Rota-006:
- Previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE

194

Reviewer Note: On page 69 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy report, the applicant states that the
exclusion criterion “Previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE” was common to all studies except
Rota-023. However, this criterion was not included in the protocol for Rota-036.
The following exclusion criteria applied to Rota-036:
- History of use of experimental RV vaccine
In addition, because Rota-006 and Rota-036 evaluated the immune response to co-administered
routine vaccine antigens, the following exclusion criteria applied:
- Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and H. flu type b (for Rota-036, also
previous vaccination against meningococcal group C in Spain and S. pneumoniae in
France/Germany)
- History of vaccine-preventable diseases mentioned above
Overall, all 4 studies included healthy infants of relatively similar age ranges at Dose 1, while
excluding infants with histories of gastrointestinal disorders or other serious medical conditions and
infants who were immunosuppressed or immunodeficient. Therefore, the generalizability of Rotarix
efficacy and immunogenicity results across studies is adequate.
In Rota-023 and Rota-036, previous confirmed RV GE was not an exclusion criterion, thereby
potentially affecting efficacy and immunogenicity results if rates of pre-vaccination RV GE were
different between vaccine and control groups. However, in Rota-023, pre-Dose 1 anti-RV IgA
seropositivity rates in the TVC immunogenicity cohort were low (Rotarix-4.5%, placebo-3.5%).
Similar pre-Dose 1 seropositivity results were seen in Rota-036 (TVC immunogenicity cohort: 2.1%
in each group), indicating that previous exposure to RV infection was uncommon among Rotarix
and placebo recipients in these two studies.
In Rota-004, Rota-006, and Rota-023, a history of experimental RV vaccination was not an
exclusion criterion, thereby also potentially affecting efficacy and immunogenicity results. The
applicant did not provide information on RV vaccination histories of subjects in these 3 studies.
However, pre-Dose 1 anti-RV IgA seropositivity rates in the TVC immunogenicity cohorts in Rota023, Rota-006 (1.5 - 2.5% in each arm), and Rota-004 (0% in each arm) indicate that previous RV
vaccination was uncommon if not rare.
Adequacy of dose finding
As mentioned in section 9.1.2, a Phase II placebo-controlled trial of the 89-12 vaccine (Avant
Immunotherapeutics) was conducted using any RV GE and very severe RV GE endpoints. In this
trial, two doses of vaccine at 105.0ffu/dose (<105.0 CCID50/dose) were administered 6-10 weeks
apart49. VE against any RV GE from post-Dose 2 to the end of the 1st RV season was 89% (95% CI:
65.4-96.5%) 49. VE against very severe RV GE (>14 points) during the same interval was 100% (no
CIs due to low numbers) 49.
In Rota-004, 2 doses of Rotarix (105.3 CCID50 titer) administered 2 months apart demonstrated
73.0% efficacy against any RV GE and 90.0% efficacy against severe RV GE during Year 1, as well
as 80.4% and 75.7% anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates at 1 month post-Dose 2 and at the end of
Year 1, respectively (see section 9.1.4). Subsequently, Rota-006 (105.3 CCID50, 105.6 CCID50, or
106.6 CCID50 titers; 2 doses 2 months apart) demonstrated a trend toward higher efficacy against
any and severe RV GE with increasing titer (see section 9.1.4). Anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates at
2 months post-Dose 2 and at the end of Year 1 also increased with increasing vaccine titer. Based
on these clinical results along with stability testing data, the applicant selected a titer of at least 106.0
CCID50 at the end of shelf-life for commercial use. In order to guarantee this end of shelf-life titer,
the release specification was set at ------- CCID50 per vial. The vaccine titer used in the two pivotal
Phase III trials was 106.5 CCID50/dose, administered 1 or 2 months apart.
9.1.4

Efficacy Findings

As mentioned in section 9.1.3, subjects enrolled and vaccinated in these studies were healthy
infants without significant past medical histories. In the ATP efficacy cohorts, the median age at

195

Dose 1, male:female ratio, and median height and weight were similar across studies. In Rota-004
and Rota-036, both conducted in Europe, nearly all subjects were Caucasian. In Rota-023,
conducted in multiple Latin American countries, most of the subjects were Hispanic. Rota-006, also
conducted in Latin America, enrolled nearly 75% of subjects who were of mixed ancestry.
The proportion of study dropouts and reasons for withdrawal were similar between treatment
groups in each study, with most dropouts due to reasons other than SAEs or non-SAEs. The
median duration of follow-up for Year 1 efficacy was 5.6 months for Rota-004, 7 months for Rota006, 8 months for Rota-023, and 6 months for Rota-036.
Year 1 efficacy/immunogenicity – any RV GE
A summary of VE against RV GE-related endpoints and immunogenicity results for all four studies
(ATP cohorts) can be found in Table 1 and Table 2 below. In Rota-036, the only pivotal Phase III trial
that evaluated efficacy against any RV GE, Year 1 efficacy was 87.1% against any RV GE, 79.3%
against any pooled non-G1 RV GE, 95.6% against any wild G1 RV GE, 88.3% against any G4 RV
GE, and 75.6% against any G9 RV GE. Although VE against any G3 RV GE was 89.9%, the lower
level of the 95% CI was only 9.5%. VE against any G2 RV GE was not statistically significant due to
limited numbers of cases. Overall, these data indicate that Rotarix at the proposed licensing dose of
106.5 CCID50 was highly effective against any RV GE during Year 1 of follow-up, and provided good
cross-protection against non-G1 strains when pooled together and analyzed individually.
Findings from Rota-036 were also supported by Rota-006 in the 106.6 CCID50cohort, where VE
against any RV GE, any wild G1 RV GE, and any pooled non-G1 RV GE was 70.0%, 76.4%, and
60.9%, respectively. A smaller sample size in this subset compared to the Rota-036 study cohort
may have contributed to the lower estimates and lower LLs of the 95% CIs. However, these results
may also reflect previous findings with other live oral vaccines (OPV, RotaShield) that demonstrated
lower immunogenicity in infants in developing countries (Rota-006 was conducted in Brazil, Mexico,
and Venezuela) 52, 53. Lower anti-RV IgA seroconversion rate (65.3%) and GMC (70.7 U/mL) postDose 2 in subjects from the 106.6 CCID50 cohort of Rota-006 were also lower than figures from
Rotarix recipients in Rota-036 (86.5% and 197.2 U/mL, respectively).
Although subjects in Rota-004 and the 105.3 CCID50 and 105.6 CCID50 treatment arms in Rota-006
were administered vaccine titers less than the proposed licensure dose, Year 1 VE against any RV
GE was 73.0%, 58.4%, and 55.7%, respectively. Year 1 VE against any wild G1 RV GE was 64.9%,
59.9%, and 79.6%, respectively. For these 6 estimates, LLs of the 95% CIs were low. Differences in
efficacy and IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs post-Dose 2, were observed between Rota-004
and the 105.3 CCID50 cohort of Rota-006 (see Table 2). These differences could have been
influenced by sample sizes and ethnic/environmental factors mentioned above.
VE against any G2 RV GE was also calculated in a post-hoc analysis by pooling cases for each
endpoint together from all studies, including cases from the lower potency groups in Rota-004 and
Rota-006. As a result, pooled VE was 78.3% (LL 95% CI: 18.4%) against any G2 RV GE. However,
upon further consultation with the CBER biostatistical reviewer, these results will not be acceptable
to demonstrate efficacy against G2 RV GE.
In Rota-036 and Rota-006, VE from Dose 1 to the end of Year 1 follow-up was calculated using
TVCs. VE against any RV GE was 87.3% in Rota-036 and 72.2% in Rota-006 (106.6group).
The impact of breastfeeding on VE and immunogenicity was evaluated in Rota-036.
The percentages of subjects who were breastfed at the time of vaccination (one dose and both
doses) were similar between groups. VE against any RV GE among subjects that breastfed at the

196

time of at least one dose was similar to VE among subjects not breastfed at any of the doses
(86.0% vs. 90.8% respectively). Post-Dose 2 seroconversion rates and GMCs were comparable
between the 2 feeding strata (85.5% vs. 89.2% and 185.8 U/mL vs 231.5 U/mL; overlapping 95%
CIs for both comparisons were present). These results indicate that breastfeeding did not impact
either VE or immunogenicity.
As mentioned in section 9.1.2, vaccine take as a measure of immunogenicity was assessed in
Rota-006. At post-Dose 1 and post-Dose 2 time points, vaccine take rates were slightly higher than
seroconversion rates. Vaccine take after any dose was 75.5% in the 106.6group.
Year 1 efficacy/immunogenicity – severe RV GE
Rota-036, Rota-004, and Rota-006 evaluated all severe RV GE efficacy endpoints using the
Vesikari scale. In contrast, Rota-023 based all but one endpoint (severe RV GE using the Vesikari
scale) on a clinical case definition of severe RV GE. In Rota-023, VE was 84.7% (84.8% using the
Vesikari scale) against severe RV GE, 91.8% against severe wild G1 RV GE, 75.4% against severe
pooled non-G1 RV GE, 87.7% against severe G3 RV GE (LL of 95% CI: 8.3%), and 90.6% against
severe G9 RV GE. Cross-protection against non-G1 strains when pooled and analyzed individually
was thus demonstrated. VE against severe G2 RV GE did not reach statistical significance, and VE
against severe G4 RV GE was not calculated, both due to limited case numbers. VE against
hospitalized RV GE was 85.0%.
In Rota-036, VE against severe RV GE was 95.8%, higher than in Rota-023. Higher efficacy was
also demonstrated against severe G1 RV GE (96.4%), severe pooled non-G1 RV GE (95.4%),
severe G3 RV GE (100%; (LL of 95% CI: 44.8%), severe G4 RV GE (100%), severe G9 RV GE
(94.7%), and hospitalized RV GE (91.8%). VE against RV GE leading to any medical attention,
evaluated only in Rota-036, was 91.8%. Seroconversion rate and GMC one to two months postDose 2 were also higher in Rota-036 than in Rota-023 (86.5% vs 76.8% and 197.2 U/mL vs 102.6
U/mL). These differences suggest that although Rotarix vaccination resulted in high efficacy in both
Latin America and Europe, protection and immunogenicity among subjects may be higher in
developed countries as compared to less developed countries, consistent with previous
observations using other live oral vaccines52, 53.
Rota-036 also evaluated VE using the Clark scale, previously used in the evaluation of RotaShield.
VE against severe RV GE (93.3%), severe G1 (93.7%), severe pooled non-G1 (92.8%), and severe
G9 (91.6%) RV GE were slightly lower than the same VE estimates using the Vesikari scale.
Efficacy against severe RV GE was also seen in Rota-004 and Rota-006. In the106.6 CCID50 group
from Rota-006, VE was 85.6% against severe RV GE, 87.8% (LL 95% CI: 48.0%) against severe
G1 RV GE, 82.7% (LL 95% CI: 40.3%) against severe pooled non-G1 RV GE, 77.4% (LL 95% CI:
17.8%) against severe G9 RV GE, and 79.0% (LL 95% CI: 24.9%) against hospitalized RV GE.
Despite using lower vaccine potency (105.3 CCID50) and a smaller sample size, Rota-004 showed a
VE of 90% (LL 95% CI: 10.3%) against severe RV GE. VE against severe RV GE in the 105.3
CCID50 group from Rota-006 was 65.8% (LL 95% CI: 32.2%).
VE against severe G2 RV GE was also calculated in a post-hoc analysis by pooling cases for each
endpoint together from all studies, including cases from the lower potency groups in Rota-004 and
Rota-006. Using the Vesikari scale for all cases (including cases from Rota-023), pooled VE was
71.4% (95% CI: 20.1-91.1%) against severe G2 RV GE. As stated above, these results will not be
acceptable to demonstrate efficacy against G2 RV GE.
In Rota-023, Rota-036, and Rota-006, VE from Dose 1 to the end of Year 1 follow-up was
calculated using TVCs. VE against severe RV GE was 81.1% in Rota-023, 96.0% in Rota-036, and

197

88.1% in Rota-006 (106.6group).
Year 2 efficacy – any RV GE
In Rota-036, statistically significant vaccine protection during the Year 2 follow-up period was
demonstrated against any RV GE (71.9%), any wild G1 RV GE (83.5%), any pooled non-G1 RV GE
(68.2%), and any G9 RV GE (71.2%). Protective efficacy against any RV GE (72.8%) and any wild
G1 RV GE (77.4%) was also seen in Rota-004, although LLs of the 95% CIs were low. None of the
estimates in Rota-006 reached statistical significance due to limited numbers of cases.
Year 2 efficacy/immunogenicity – severe RV GE
Protective efficacy against severe RV GE endpoints during Year 2 follow-up was observed in both
pivotal trials, with all VE estimates being higher in Rota-036 than Rota-023 (see Table 1). In Rota023, VE against severe RV GE was 79.0% (81.5% using the Vesikari scale), while in Rota-036, VE
against the same endpoint was 85.6%. VE against hospitalized RV GE was 81.5% in Rota-023 and
92.2% in Rota-036. In Rota-023, VE was 81.5% against severe G1 RV GE, 80.1% against severe
pooled non-G1 RV GE, 63.1% against severe G4 RV GE, and 87.7% against severe G9 RV GE.
However, the LL of the 95% CI for VE against severe G4 RV GE was low (34.5% and 0.7%,
respectively). In Rota-036, VE was 96.5% against severe G1 RV GE, 80.8% against severe pooled
non-G1 RV GE, and 77.7% against severe G9 RV GE. In addition, VE against severe G2 RV GE
(89.9%; LL 95% CI = 9.4%) was demonstrated, the first time an endpoint involving G2 type resulted
in statistically significant VE in any of the studies.
In Rota-004, VE efficacy against severe RV GE (83.4%; LL 95% CI: 7.2%) and severe G1 RV GE
(91.7%; LL 95% CI: 31.6%) was observed. Although immunogenicity analyses indicated a drop in
seroconversion rates and GMCs from Year 1 to Year 2, 67.2% of Rotarix subjects were seropositive
for anti-RV IgA antibodies at the end of Year 2. VE against these same endpoints did not reach
statistical significance in Rota-006.
Combined period efficacy (Year 1 and Year 2) – any RV GE
VE against RV GE was demonstrated for the combined efficacy follow-up period. In Rota-036, VE
was 78.9% against any RV GE and 89.8% against any G1 RV GE. In addition, VE against any
pooled non-G1 RV GE was 72.9% and VE estimates against G2 (58.3%; LL 95% CI: 10.1%), G3
(84.8%; LL 95% CI: 41.0%), G4 (83.1%), and G9 (72.9%) types were all statistically significant. In
Rota-004, VE against any RV GE and any G1 RV GE was 71.6% and 72.6%, respectively. In Rota006, VE against any RV GE and any G1 RV GE was 62.4% and 77.6%, respectively. The LLs of
the 95% CIs for the estimates from Rota-004 and Rota-006 were less than 50%.
In Rota-036 and Rota-006, VE from Dose 1 to the end of Year 2 follow-up was calculated using
TVCs. VE against any RV GE was 79.4% in Rota-036 and 38.0% (LL 95% CI = -7.5%) in Rota-006
(106.6group).
Combined period efficacy (Year 1 and Year 2) – severe RV GE
Protective efficacy against severe RV GE was also demonstrated during the combined efficacy
period. In Rota-023, VE against severe RV GE was 80.5% (82.5% using the Vesikari scale), while
in Rota-036, VE against the same endpoint was 90.4%. VE against hospitalized RV GE was 83.0%
in Rota-023 and 96.0% for Rota-036. In Rota-023, statistically significant VE was observed against
severe G1 (82.1%), severe pooled non-G1 (77.5%), severe G3 (78.9; LL 95% CI: 24.5%), severe
G4 (61.8%; LL 95% CI: 4.1%), and severe G9 RV GE (86.6%). In Rota-036, efficacy was observed
against severe G1 (96.4%), severe pooled non-G1 (87.7%), severe G2 (85.5%; LL 95% CI: 24.0%),
severe G3 (93.7%), severe G4 (95.4%), and severe G9 RV GE (85.0%).

198

In Rota-006 (106.6group), VE was 92.6% against severe RV GE and 90.4% (LL 95% CI: 32.8%)
against severe G1 RV GE, figures similar to Rota-036 and higher than Rota-023. In Rota-004, VE
against these two endpoints were 84.9% (LL 95% CI: 41.5%) and 90.0%, respectively.
In Rota-023, Rota-036 and Rota-006, VE from Dose 1 to the end of Year 2 follow-up was calculated
using TVCs. VE against any RV GE was 80.3% in Rota-023, 90.7% in Rota-036 and 86.1% in Rota006 (106.6group).
RV immunogenicity – other BLA studies
Anti-RV IgA responses were also measured in all or a subset of subjects from Rota-005, Rota-007,
Rota-014 and Rota-033 by ELISA at the laboratory of Dr. R. Ward (Cincinnati), and in Rota-039,
Rota-048, and Rota-060 by GSK ELISA in Belgium. Vaccine take rates were calculated in all
studies except Rota-060.
Among subjects in Rota-005, Rota-007, Rota-039, Rota-048, and Rota-060 who were administered
Rotarix at a potency of at least 106.6CCID50 per dose, anti-RV IgA rates at 1 to 2 months post-Dose
2 ranged from 78.2- 88.3%, comparable to seroconversion rates for Rota-023 and Rota-036 (see
Tables 3 and 4 below). GMCs at 1-2 months post-Dose 2 ranged from 117.0- 188.2 U/mL, also
similar to GMCs for Rota-023 and Rota-036; the only exception was in Rota-048, where 1 month
post-Dose 2 GMC was 360.6 U/mL.
In Rota-005, where most of the subjects were from the U.S., 1-2 month post-Dose 2 seroconversion
rate (78.2%) and GMC (117.0 U/mL) were less than estimates from Rota-036 (86.5% and 197.2
U/mL). Although the sample size of the ATP immunogenicity cohort was larger in Rota-036 than in
Rota-005 (794 vs 209), the median age at Dose 1 was also higher in Rota-036 than in Rota-005
(11.0 weeks vs 9 weeks)
Reviewer Note: On page 57 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy, the applicant labeled Table 18 as
“Anti-HRV IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs two months after dose 2 in study Rota-007 (ATP
cohort for immunogenicity).” However, on page 107 of the Rota-007 Study Report, the same rate
and GMC were listed on line PII(M2) which meant “one month after the second dose of HRV
vaccine or placebo (Visit 3).”
Vaccine take rates at 1-2 months after any dose (i.e. combined Dose 1 and Dose 2 take rate)
ranged from 88.0- 97.8% (Rota-005: 88.0%), higher than in Rota-006 (75.5%). The highest vaccine
take rate was observed in Rota-007 (97.8%), the study with the oldest aged cohort (11-17 weeks at
Dose 1).
Rota-014
Among the BLA studies, only Rota-014 allowed co-administration of OPV. Although Rotarix potency
in this study (105.6 CCID50 per dose) was below that of the licensure dose, interference of the antiRV IgA immune response post-Dose 1 was observed in the Rotarix-OPV co-administered group
compared to the Rotarix-IPV co-administered group. In the subset (ATP immunogenicity cohort)
vaccinated before the RV season, the seroconversion rate for the HRV+OPV group was 13.3%
(95% CI: 5.9-24.6%), lower than the 32.8% (95% CI: 21.0-46.3%) in the HRV+IPV group. GMC was
<20 U/mL in the HRV+OPV group compared to 23.9 U/mL in the HRV+IPV group.
However, in this same subset, 1 month post-Dose 2 rates in the Rotarix+OPV group increased to
35.8% (95% CI: 23.1-50.2%) compared to 42.9% (28.8-57.8%) in the Rotarix+IPV group. Post-Dose
2 GMC was 28.1 U/mL in the HRV+OPV group compared to 32.6 U/mL in the HRV+IPV group. The
GMC ratio (HRV+IPV/ HRV+OPV) was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.6-2.2). Seroconversion rates for the
combined Rotarix doses were 40.7% (95% CI: 27.6-55.0%) for the HRV+OPV group and 50.0%
(95% CI: 36.1-63.9%) for the HRV+IPV group. Vaccine take rates on combined Rotarix doses were

199

43.8% for the HRV+OPV group and 50.0% for the HRV+IPV group; the rate difference between the
two groups was not statistically significant
Rota-033
Lot-to-lot consistency of 3 consecutive production lots of Rotarix (106.6group potency) was
evaluated. The following lots were used:
Lot A: RVC018A42 (used in Rota-023 and Rota-036)
Lot B: RVC019A43 (used in Rota-023)
Lot C: RVC021A44 (used in Rota-023)
Subjects in each Rotarix lot group received 2 doses 2 months apart. Lots were considered to be
consistent at 2 months post-Dose 2 if all 90% CIs for the ratio of GMCs between two lots were
within the pre-specified interval (0.5-2.0). Post-hoc analyses were also performed using the
following FDA criteria: 95% CIs of GMC ratios with the same pre-specified interval.
Anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates for each group using the Ward ELISA are summarized in the
table below. Seroconversion rates appeared similar between all Rotarix groups. GMC of Lot B
appeared lower compared to the other 2 lots.

Reviewer Note: To explore the reasons for the low GMC in Lot B, additional statistical analyses
were performed. GMCs and seroconversion rates were higher in Mexico than Peru and Colombia
as a result of older age at vaccination (9 weeks vs 8 weeks and 8 weeks) and longer interval
between Dose 1 and Dose 2 (64 days vs 51 and 58 days). Among the lots in Peru and Colombia,
Lot B had the lowest GMC. Among the lots in Mexico, Lot B and Lot C had similarly low GMCs
compared to Lot A.
When the applicant performed a second analysis using a 2-way ANOVA model to adjust for country
effect, the adjusted GMCs were slightly higher than the unadjusted GMCs (Lot A- 93.4 U/mL, Lot B67.9 U/mL, Lot C – 90.2 U/mL). However, when analyses were performed using the adjusted GMCs
(for country effect), criteria for consistency was still met for all 3 pair-wise comparisons. The
applicant concluded that the lower GMC for lot B could be explained by random variability.
Rota-060
Seroconversion rates and GMC for the group co-administered Rotarix (106.5potency) and routine
vaccines (co-ad group) and the group administered Rotarix separately from routine vaccines (sep-

202

ad group) are summarized in Table 3 below. Although blood samples were obtained at different
time points (2 months post-Dose 2 for the sep-ad group; 3 months post-Dose 2 for the co-ad
group), seroconversion rates were similar between groups, and the rate difference between the coad group minus the sep-ad group was not statistically significant (-7.16%, 95% CI: -15.84-1.98).
The GMC ratio (co-ad/sep-ad) was statistically significant (0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.86), and may have
been due to differences in blood collection time points and age at Rotarix vaccination (co-ad group:
2 and 4 months; sep-ad group: 3 and 5 months).
In the sep-ad group, the seroconversion rate (86.0%) and GMC (188.2 U/mL) measured at 2
months post-Dose 2 were similar to the 1-2 month post-Dose 2 seroconversion rate and GMC in
Rota-036 (86.5% and 197.2 U/mL). Although the seroconversion rate (78.8%) and GMC (110.0
U/mL) in the co-ad group were lower than the sep-ad group and the subset in Rota-036, these
measurements were taken 3 months post-Dose 2. These figures were also comparable to 1-2
month immunogenicity data from Rota-023 (76.8% and 102.6 U/mL) and 2-month post-Dose 2
estimates from Rota-005 (78.2% and 117 U/mL), and higher than 2-month post-Dose 2 data from
the 106.6CCID50 group in Rota-006 (65.3% and 70.7 U/mL).
Breastfeeding and RV immunogenicity
The impact of breastfeeding on RV immunogenicity was evaluated in Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota007, and Rota-036. All studies allowed unrestricted feeding prior to vaccination.
Rota-006
As mentioned in section 8.1.4, none of the 4 feeding criteria (exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding
+ formula feeding, feeding within 1 hour pre-vaccination, feeding within 30 minutes postvaccination) had a significant effect on vaccine take.
Rota-036
The impact of breastfeeding on VE was evaluated only in Rota-036. As reviewed in section 8.1.2,
feeding patterns were similar between treatment groups. VE against any RV GE for the 2 feeding
strata (breastfed for at least one dose, not breastfed at any of the doses) were similar (86.0%
versus 90.8%). Similarly, VE against severe RV GE was similar for each of the feeding strata
(95.7% vs. 96.2%, respectively), indicating that breastfeeding had no impact on Rotarix VE. Visit 3
(1-3 months post-Dose 2) seroconversion rates and GMCs were similar by feeding category.
Among subjects who were breastfed at one or more doses, the anti-RV IgA seroconversion rate
and GMC in Rotarix recipients were 85.5% and 185.8 U/ml, respectively. Among non-breastfed
subjects, the seroconversion rate and GMC in Rotarix recipients were 89.2% and 231.5 U/ml,
respectively. 95% CIs for seroconversion rates and GMCs both overlapped between feeding strata.

Immunogenicity analyses suggested that vaccine take rates were lower in subjects exclusively
breastfed compared to subjects not breastfed. Among subjects that were only breastfed, the vaccine
take rate on combined Doses 1 and 2 at Visit 3 (2 months post-Dose 2) was 72.3% (95% CI: 57.484.4%) in the 105.6CCID50 group and 83.7% (70.3-92.7%) in the 106.8CCID50 group. Among subjects
not breastfed, the combined vaccine take rate was 89.9% (95% CI: 81.7-95.3%) in the 105.6CCID50
group and 89.3% (80.6-95.0%) in the 106.8CCID50 group. Among subjects both breastfed and formula
fed, the combined vaccine take rate was 66.7% (95% CI: 43.0-85.4%) in the 105.6CCID50 group and
94.1% (71.3-99.9%) in the 106.8CCID50 group.
Results of an exploratory logistic regression analysis demonstrated that vaccine take was
significantly lower in breastfed Rotarix recipients at both potencies (p=0.03). When other additional
factors, such as formula feeding and timing of feeding, were added to breastfeeding exposure, the
prediction of vaccine take did not improve (all p-values were >0.1)
Rota-007
No reliable conclusions about the impact of breastfeeding on RV immunogenicity could be made
from this study because most of the subjects in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity were formula fed
after Dose 1 (105.3CCID50 - 78.7%, 105.6CCID50 - 75.9%, 106.6CCID50 - 73.7%) and Dose 2
(105.3CCID50 - 84.4%, 105.6CCID50 - 79.7%, 106.6CCID50 - 79.6%). However, the combined anti-RV IgA
seroconversion rate at Visit 2 (1 month post-Dose 1), Visit 3 (1 month post-Dose 2), or Visit 4 (2
months post-Dose 2) was similar between formula-fed and breastfed Rotarix recipients pooled from
all dose potencies (93.3% vs 85.7%; overlapping 95% CIs).
In addition, among all Rotarix recipients, frequencies of feeding within 30 minutes after vaccination
were low (after Dose 1 - 10%, after Dose 2 - 10%, after both doses - 3%); none of these subjects
fed within 1 hour before vaccination. The combined anti-RV IgA seroconversion rate (i.e.
seroconversion at Visit 2, Visit 3, or Visit 4) was 97.5% in subjects that fed within 30 minutes after
Dose 1 only, 80% in subjects that fed within 30 minutes after Dose 2 only, 90.9% in subjects that
fed within 30 minutes after both doses, and 93.2% in subjects not in the previous 3 categories (95%
CIs of all 4 estimates were overlapping).
Maternal antibodies and RV immunogenicity
The effect of maternally acquired anti-RV antibodies on immunogenicity was assessed in a subset
of subjects from Rota-004, Rota-006, and Rota-014. The levels of pre-vaccination maternal
antibodies were higher in vaccine non-responders compared to responders after 2 doses. In
general, subjects with seroconversion after Dose 1 had lower levels of maternal serum antibodies
(anti-RV IgA and anti-RV neutralizing antibody) prior to vaccination than vaccine non-responders.
However, it was also shown that seroconversion could be induced after administration of a second
vaccine dose despite high levels of maternal antibodies.

Efficacy/Immunogenicity Conclusions

Rotarix, administered at a titer of 106.5 CCID50 and as a 2-dose series (1 to 2 months apart) to healthy
infants 6 to 14 weeks of age, was effective in preventing RV GE of any severity and in preventing
severe RV GE caused by naturally-occurring RV strains during the first year of follow-up. In Rota-006,
point estimates for any and severe VE were lower for 105.3 CCID50 and 105.6 CCID50 titers. In Rota004, point estimates for any and severe VE at 105.3 CCID50 were lower than in Rota-036 (106.5
CCID50). Protective efficacy was also observed during the second year of follow-up. Although not
evaluated in the US, VE was observed across heterogeneous geographical populations. In general,
VE estimates were higher in the European study cohorts (Rota-036, Rota-004) than the Latin
American cohorts (Rota-023, Rota-006). Based on pivotal study Rota-036, breastfeeding did not
appear to impact Rotarix VE.
Statistically significant protection was demonstrated against any RV GE and severe RV GE caused
by circulating G1 and non-G1 types when pooled together. VE for these endpoints were also
statistically significant for G3, G4, and G9 subtypes during Year 1 and the combined period.
Although efficacy against any and severe G2 RV GE was not demonstrated during Year 1 in any of
the studies, statistically significant VE against these G2 endpoints was reached when all cases
were pooled together in a post-hoc analysis. However, CBER views these results as unacceptable
to demonstrate efficacy against G2 RV GE during Year 1. Post-marketing surveillance for vaccine
failures associated with G2 RV GE, along with other individual non-G1 types, should be conducted.
Two doses of Rotarix at a potency of ≥ 106.5 CCID50 per dose were also immunogenic in infants, as
demonstrated by post-Dose 2 anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates, GMCs, and vaccine take rates. In
Rota-006, GMC was lower in the 105.6 CCID50 group compared to the 106.6 CCID50 group.
Immunogenicity results from Rota-006 and Rota-036 indicated that breastfeeding did not
significantly impact anti-RV IgA seroconversion post-vaccination.
Overall, efficacy data from these trials support the proposed indication of prevention of RV GE.

Overview of Safety Across Trials

10.1

Safety Database - Number of Subjects, Types of Subjects and Extent of Exposure

Numbers and characteristics of subjects in each of the 11 BLA studies are summarized in Table 1
and Table 2 in Appendix 1. A total of 75,353 infants received at least one dose of Rotarix or
placebo. Of these infants, 40,614 infants received at least one dose of Rotarix and 34,739 infants
received at least one dose of placebo. A total of 78,980 doses of Rotarix and 67,349 doses of
placebo were administered.
Among the Rotarix recipients, 37,214 subjects received vaccine at the potency (≥ 106.0 CCID50 per
dose), formulation (lyophilized, buffered), and storage temperature (2° to 8°C) intended for
commercial use in the U.S. A total 72,242 doses were administered.
Among the Rotarix recipients, 3076 subjects received vaccine at a potency less than 106.0 CCID50
per dose. A total 6098 doses were administered.

207

Across the studies, 90.5-99.1% of Rotarix recipients and 90.3-100% of placebo recipients received
two study doses.
In Rota-006, 30 subjects in the ≥ 106.0 CCID50 group, 61 subjects in the < 106.0 CCID50 group, and 30
subjects in the placebo received a third dose. These doses were not included in the Integrated
Safety Summary (ISS) analyses described below. However, the safety of Dose 3 has been
reviewed in section 8.1.4.
All enrolled and vaccinated subjects were healthy male or female infants without obvious health
problems. The age range at the time of Dose 1 was 5-17 weeks. Male-to-female ratio, height, and
weight were generally similar between studies. In each study, the majority of subjects were
White/Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Mixed ancestry, or Oriental.
Seven of the studies enrolled only infants who were born at ≥ 36 weeks of gestation, while three
studies included only infants who had a birth weight > 2000 grams.

Solicited General AEs
Solicited general AEs were collected from all or a subset of subjects in 9 of the 11 studies (data not
collected for Rota-023 and Rota-060). AEs consisted of diarrhea, fussiness/irritability, loss of appetite,
fever, and vomiting. Cough/runny nose was included as an AE except in Rota-004 and Rota-033. In
Rota-036, data on the type of medical attention (i.e. medical personnel contact, advice, or visit;
emergency room contact/visit; hospitalization) received for AEs was also collected.
In Rota-033 and Rota-036, AE data was collected from Day 0 to Day 7 post-vaccination, while in
the remaining studies, data was collected from Day 0 to Day 14. In all studies, AEs were recorded
on diary cards by parents/guardians.
For each AE, a standard scale was used for all studies to grade AE intensity (see table below).

Unsolicited AEs
Unsolicited AEs were collected from all subjects in 10 of the 11 studies (data not collected for Rota023). AEs were coded and reported using MedDRA in Rota-023, Rota-033, Rota-036, Rota-039,
Rota-048, and Rota-060. AEs were initially coded and reported using the WHO dictionary for
adverse reaction terminology in the remaining 5 studies, but were re-coded using MedDRA. In
Rota-036, data on type of medical attention (i.e. medical personnel, contact, advice, or vist;
emergency room contact or visit; hospitalization) received for AEs was also collected.

210

In Rota-033, Rota-036, Rota-039, and Rota-048, AE data was collected from Days 0 to 30 postvaccination, while in the other studies, data was collected from Days 0 to 42. In Rota-060, only new
onset of chronic illness(es) that were not congenital anomalies and conditions prompting
emergency room visits were considered as unsolicited AEs.
For each AE, the following standard scale was used for all studies to grade AE intensity:
Grade 1 =
Grade 2 =
Grade 3 =

Easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering
with everyday activities
Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities
Prevented normal, everyday activities (In a young child, for example, prevented
attendance at a day-care center and caused parents/guardians to seek
medical advice)

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
SAEs were collected and reported in all studies throughout the study period and coded using the
same methods (MedDRA, WHO dictionary) as for unsolicited AEs. Any SAE was reported to GSK
within 24 hours using the SAE Report Form. The following definition of an SAE was applied:
-

Any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent
or significant disability/incapacity, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing
hospitalization. In addition, important medical events that may have jeopardized the subject or may
have required intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above were considered
serious.

An IDMC consisting of external clinical experts and a biostatistician was established in May 2002 to
independently monitor safety aspects of the Rotarix vaccine clinical development. In addition, two
other independent committees, a Clinical Events Committee and a Safety Review Committee, were
formed to review data in Rota-023 (see section 8.1.1.1.6).
Intussusception (IS)
Special procedures were planned and implemented to rapidly identify and treat IS in all studies.
Rota-023 was specifically designed and powered to assess the risk of IS following Rotarix
vaccination, and has already been described in detail in section 8.1.1. In the other studies (except
Rota-060), parents/guardians were made aware of the symptoms of IS (severe colicky abdominal
pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating, high fever) and were instructed to
inform the investigator and seek medical advice at the nearest hospital. Investigators were also
aware of a possible increased risk of IS, and took appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures.
Cases of IS were diagnosed by radiography. All studies (except Rota-004 and Rota-060) required
completion of an IS Form in addition to documentation in the CRF.
Causality of AEs
In studies where co-administration of routine vaccines was allowed (all except Rota-004 and Rota048), the investigators assessed whether the AE was causally related to vaccination rather than to
individual vaccines.

211

Concomitant medications
Numbers and percentages of subjects in each treatment group who received any concomitant
medication (medication except for vitamins or dietary supplements), any antipyretic medication, any
prophylactic antipyretic medication, and any antibiotic post-vaccination were tabulated in each study
except Rota-023.
Statistical analyses
Integrated safety summary
An integrated safety summary (ISS) analysis based on TVC (i.e. subjects who received at least one
Rotarix or placebo vaccine) safety data from 10 of the 11 clinical studies (only Rota-060 not
included) was conducted after an agreement between CBER and GSK at a pre-BLA meeting on
June 21, 2006. The ISS analysis involved the pooling of subjects from the 10 studies into the
following two analysis groups to allow for precise estimation of Rotarix safety at the licensing
potency for the US (≥ 106.0 CCID50 per dose):
-

Core ISS group: pooled subjects who received Rotarix at ≥ 106.0 CCID50 per dose or placebo
(subjects pooled from Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-023, Rota-033, Rota-036, Rota-039,
and Rota-048)

-

Supplementary ISS group: pooled subjects who received Rotarix at < 106.0 CCID50 per dose or
placebo (subjects pooled from Rota-004, Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, and Rota-014)

Core ISS analysis
A total of 36,755 subjects received 71,320 doses of Rotarix at a potency ≥ 106.0 CCID50 per dose.
The distribution by individual study is summarized in the table below. Of note, in both the Core ISS
and Supplementary ISS analyses, the same numbers of placebo subjects and doses were used
(i.e. Rota-005, Rota-006, and Rota-007).

Safety Endpoints
The following safety endpoints were analyzed for each ISS group:
- Individual solicited AEs (any intensity and Grade 3) from Days 0-7 post-vaccination
- Unsolicited AEs (any intensity and Grade 3) from Days 0-30 post-vaccination
- Fatal events from Days 0-30 post-vaccination and during the entire study course
- SAEs from Days 0-30 post-vaccination and during the entire study course
- Discontinuation due to non-SAE or SAE (discontinuation defined as missing a study
visit/planned concluding visit/study dose due to an AE/SAE)
- Concomitant medication use (any medication, any antipyretic, prophylactic antipyretic, any
antibiotic) post-vaccination
The relative risk (RR; percentage in Rotarix group/percentage in placebo group), along with 95%
CIs, was calculated for each safety endpoint based on exact conditional likelihood approach
adjusted for the study effect.
For both ISS groups, post-Dose 2 safety data from 121 subjects in the 3-dose subset of Rota-006
were excluded. Analysis of solicited AEs included only subjects and doses with a completed
solicited AE CRF/eCRF. Subjects not reporting unsolicited AEs were treated as subjects without an
unsolicited AE. Also, analysis of SAEs coded to the MedRA PT Intussusception was based on the
onset date and not diagnosis (as in Rota-023), and included cases besides those categorized as
“definite IS.”
Results of individual studies
In addition to ISS analyses, the Summary of Clinical Safety report also presented TVC safety
results from the following individual studies: Rota-023 (pivotal Phase III), Rota-005 (Phase II,
US/Canada), Rota-033 (lot-to-lot consistency study), and Rota-036 (pivotal Phase III)

Core ISS analysis
Deaths – Day 0 to Day 30 post-vaccination
A total of 53 deaths (pooled Rotarix group-33, pooled placebo-20) were reported from Days 0-30
post-vaccination. The RR was 1.64 (95% CI: 0.92-3.02). For each MedDRA SOC or PT, there were
no significant differences between groups (i.e. 95% CIs of RR did not include 1.0). Among the
SOCs, the highest number of deaths was coded under the SOC Infections and infestations (Rotarix14, placebo-9; RR=1.55, 95% CI: 0.62-4.06). Among the PTs, the highest number of deaths was
coded under the PT Pneumonia (Rotarix-7, placebo-5; RR-1.39, 95% CI: 0.38-5.57).
Deaths – entire study period
A total of 118 deaths (pooled Rotarix group-68, pooled placebo-50) were reported throughout the
course of the studies. The RR was 1.31 (95% CI: 0.89-1.93). There were no significant differences
between groups for each MedDRA SOC or PT. Among the SOCs, the highest number of deaths
was coded under the SOC Infections and infestations (Rotarix-31, placebo-21; RR=1.40, 95% CI:
0.78-2.57). Among the PTs, the highest number of deaths was coded under the PT Pneumonia
(Rotarix-19, placebo-10; RR-1.74, 95% CI: 0.76-4.23).
Supplementary ISS analysis
Deaths – Day 0 to Day 30 post-vaccination
A total of 7 deaths (Rotarix-3, placebo-4) were reported from Day 0-30 post-vaccination. The RR
was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.06-2.27). For each MedDRA SOC or PT, there were no significant differences
between groups. Among the SOCs, the highest number of deaths was coded under the SOC
Infections and infestations (Rotarix-2, placebo-3; RR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.03-3.01). Only one death was
coded under PT Pneumonia (Rotarix group).

215

Deaths – study period
A total of 11 deaths (Rotarix-5, placebo-6) were reported throughout the course of the studies. The
RR was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.10-1.67). There were no significant differences between groups for each
MedDRA SOC or PT. Among the SOCs, the highest number of deaths was coded under the SOC
Infections and infestations (Rotarix-4, placebo-5; RR=0.41, 95% CI: 0.08-1.90). There were 2
deaths coded under the PT Pneumonia (Rotarix-1, placebo-1).
Individual studies – Rota-023 (pivotal Phase III, Latin America plus Finland)
Study deaths, including pneumonia deaths, were reviewed in detail in section 8.1.1.
Individual studies - Rota-036 (pivotal Phase III, Europe)
Death analysis results were reviewed in detail in section 8.1.2.
Individual studies – Rota-005 (Phase II, US and Canada)
A total of 529 infants from the US (N=448) and Canada (N=81) received at least one dose of
Rotarix or placebo (Rotarix 105.3 CCID50 -212, Rotarix 106.8 CCID50 -209, placebo-108). Two study
doses were given 2 months apart. US infants were co-administered Infanrix, OmniHIB or ActHIB or
Combax, IPOL, and Prevnar, while Canadian infants were co-administered Pentacel. Subjects were
followed for 10 months post-Dose 1.
No deaths were reported in any of the treatment groups during the study.
Individual studies – Rota-033 (Phase III, Lot-to-lot consistency, Latin America)
A total of 854 infants from Colombia, Mexico and Peru received at least one dose from one of three
106.5 CCID50/dose lots of Rotarix or placebo (lot A -243, lot B-241, lot C-246, placebo-124). Two
study doses were given 2 months apart. Although co-administration of routine DTwP-HepB/Hib
vaccine was allowed, over 80% of subjects were not co-administered routine vaccine with study
vaccine. Subjects were followed for 4 months post-Dose 1.
Three deaths were reported during the study as follows:
1. Death 1 – 5 month female, Mexico, cardiorespiratory arrest due to bronchial aspiration 72 days
post-Dose 1 of Lot A Rotarix; not related to study vaccine
2. Death 2 – 5 month male, Mexico, multiple foci pneumonia beginning 37 days post-Dose 2 of Lot
C Rotarix; not related to study vaccine
3. Death 3 – 4 month male, Colombia, bronchiolitis beginning 58 days post-Dose 1 of Lot B
Rotarix, later developed seizures and septic shock/DIC possibly due to shigellosis, final
diagnoses - pneumonia, GE possibly due to shigellosis; not related to study vaccine
Individual studies – Rota-060 (Phase III, US, concomitant routine vaccination)
A total of 484 infants from the US received at least one dose of the study vaccine (Rotarix 106.5
CCID50/dose, Pediarix, Prevnar or ActHIB). From the total, 249 subjects were assigned to the coadministration group (Rotarix co-administered with routine vaccines) and 235 were assigned to the
separately administered group (Rotarix administered separately from routine vaccines). Two doses
of Rotarix were given 2 months apart. Subjects were followed for 8-9 months post-Dose 1.
No deaths were reported in any of the treatment groups during the study.

Among the SOCs, a significant difference between groups in SAE rates (i.e. rates of subjects who
reported at least one PT in the specified SOC) was observed only for the SOC Metabolism and nutrition
disorders (Rotarix-0.03%, placebo-0.07%; RR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.21-0.97).
No SAE PT was reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects. Significant differences in SAE rates between
groups were observed for the following PTs:
SOC Gastrointestinal disorders
PT Diarrhoea (Rotarix-0.02%, placebo-0.07%; RR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.14-0.78)
SOC Infections and infestations
PT Gastroenteritis (Rotarix-0.20%, placebo-0.32%; RR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.45-0.84)
SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders
PT Dehydration (Rotarix-0.02%, placebo-0.06%; RR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.17-0.97)
Rates of SAEs under the PT Pneumonia (Rotarix-0.33%, placebo-0.35%) and PT Convulsions
(Rotarix-0.02%, placebo-0.02%) were similar or the same between groups. No SAEs under the PT
Kawasaki’s disease were reported in either group.
Rates of SAEs under the PT Intussusception (SOC Gastrointestinal disorders) were the same in
both groups (Rotarix-9 cases, 0.024%; placebo-7 cases, 0.020%). SAEs under the PT
Hematochezia were not reported in either group. In Rota-023, considered the core study on IS risk,
definite (adjudicated) IS was reported in 6 Rotarix recipients and 7 placebo recipients from Day 030 post-vaccination. Details of all IS analyses for Rota-023 were reviewed in section 8.1.1.
Reviewer Note: In addition to the 6 definite cases of IS in the Rotarix group from Rota-023, the 3
other IS cases in the Rotarix group included in the Core ISS analysis for PT Intussusception were:
Rota-023:
definite IS, onset on Day 29 post-Dose 1 (diagnosis on Day 31 post-Dose 1)
Rota-023:
probable IS, onset on Day 22 post-Dose 2
Rota-036:
IS, onset 8 days post-Dose 2
SAEs – entire study period
A total of 4519 subjects (Rotarix-2219, placebo-2300) reported at least 1 SAE during the entire
study period. The rate was significantly less in the Rotarix group compared to the placebo group
(RR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.94). The following table summarizes SAE reporting by MedDRA SOC:

Significant differences in rates between groups were observed for the following SOCs:
SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (Rotarix-0.30%, placebo-0.35%; RR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.56-0.94)
SOC Infections and infestations (Rotarix-4.73%, placebo-5.51%; RR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90)
SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders (Rotarix-0.17%, placebo-0.28%; RR=0.62, 95%
CI: 0.44-0.86)
Only the PTs Gastroenteritis and Pneumonia were reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects (1.3% and
1.2 %, respectively). Significant differences in SAE rates between groups were observed for the
following PTs:
SOC Gastrointestinal disorders
PT Diarrhoea (Rotarix-0.07%, placebo-0.10%; RR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.30-0.85)
PT Ileus (Rotarix-0.00%, placebo-0.02%; RR=0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.85)
SOC Infections and infestations
PT Gastroenteritis (Rotarix-1.25%, placebo-2.07%; RR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.55-0.69)
PT Gastroenteritis rotavirus (Rotarix-0.02%, placebo-0.11%; RR=0.10, 95% CI: 0.03-0.24)
SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders
PT Dehydration (Rotarix-0.15%, placebo-0.25%; RR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.89)
In addition, rates of SAEs under PT Foreign body trauma were significantly higher in the Rotarix
group compared to the placebo group (Rotarix-11, 0.03%, placebo-1, 0.00%; RR-9.11, 95% CI:
1.31-394.8). All cases involved swallowing a foreign body between 48-483 days post-dose, and
were assessed as not related to vaccination.
Rates of SAEs under the PT Intussusception were similar in both groups (Rotarix-16 cases, 0.04%;
placebo-22 cases, 0.06%). SAEs under the PT Hematochezia occurred in 1 subject in each group.
Rates of SAEs under the PT Pneumonia (Rotarix-1.23%, placebo-1.28%) and PT Convulsions
(Rotarix-0.09%, placebo-0.06%) were similar or the same between groups.
Only 1 SAE under the PT Kawasaki’s disease was reported (Rota-023, Rotarix group; see section
8.1.1.2.3).
Supplementary ISS analysis
SAEs – Day 0 to Day 30 post-vaccination
A total of 80 subjects (Rotarix-56, placebo-24) reported at least 1 SAE from Days 0-30 postvaccination. Overall SAE rates were not significantly different between groups (RR=1.23, 95% CI:
0.75-2.08). Significant differences in SAE rates between groups were not observed for any SOC or
PT. No SAE PT was reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects.

219

Only 1 SAE under the PT Intussusception was reported (Rotarix group). SAEs under the PTs
Hematochezia or Kawasaki’s disease were not reported in either group.
SAEs – entire study period
A total of 425 subjects (Rotarix-279, placebo-146) reported at least 1 SAE during the entire study
period. Overall SAE rates were not significantly different between groups (RR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.811.22). Significant differences in SAE rates between groups were not observed for any SOC or PT.
Only the PTs Gastroenteritis and Pneumonia were reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects (2.2% and
1.9 %, respectively).
SAEs under the PT Intussusception were reported in 2 (0.07%) Rotarix recipients and 1 (0.06%)
placebo recipient. One SAE under the PTs Hematochezia was reported in each of the groups.
Three SAEs under PT Kawasaki’s disease were reported in the Rotarix group (see section
Kawasaki disease – BLA studies below).
Individual studies - Rota-023
SAE analysis has already been reviewed in detail in section 8.1.1.
Individual studies – Rota-036
SAE analysis has already been reviewed in detail in section 8.1.2.
Individual studies – Rota-005
A total of 21 subjects reported an SAE during the study (105.6 CCID50- 8, 106.8 CCID50-7,
placebo-6). None of the SAEs were judged as related to vaccination. Of these, only 4 subjects
reported an SAE from Day 0-30 post-vaccination as follows:
Bronchiolitis, Dehydration – 5 days post-Dose 2, 105.6 CCID50
Gastroesophageal reflux disease – 7 days post-Dose 1, 106.8 CCID50
Lymphadenitis – 8 days post-Dose 2, 106.8 CCID50
Febrile infection – 1 day post-Dose 1, placebo
There were no cases of intussusception.
The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 SAE in the 106.8 CCID50 (3.3%) was lower than in
Rota-023 (5.6%), Rota-036 (10.96%), and Rota-006 (11.93%).
Individual studies – Rota-033
A total of 17 subjects (Lot A-4, Lot B-8, Lot C-4, placebo-1) reported an SAE during the study
period. All SAEs were judged as not related to vaccination. Only 5 subjects reported an SAE from
Days 0-30 post-vaccination as follows:
Gastroenteritis – 20 days post-Dose 2, placebo
Gastroenteritis – 17 days post-Dose 2, Lot B
Dysentery, Gastroenteritis – 5 days post-Dose 1, Lot B
Bronchiolitis – 14 days post-Dose 1, Lot B
Bronchospasm, Pneumonia – 22 days post-Dose 2, Lot B
Individual studies – Rota-060
A total of 29 subjects (co-adm group-15 [6.0%], sep-admin group-14 [6.0%]) reported an SAE
during the study period. Only one SAE was judged to be related to vaccination (see below). Ten
SAEs were reported from Days 0-30 as follows:
RSV bronchiolitis – 28 days post-Dose 3 of routine vaccines, co-admin group
Pneumonia – 15 days post-Dose 2, co-admin group

220

Viral infection – 9 days post-Dose 1, co-admin group (vaccine-related)
Brain neoplasm malignant – 3 days post-Dose 1 of routine vaccine, sep-admin group
Croup infectious – 4 days post-Dose 2 of routine vaccine, sep-admin group
Pyelonephritis – 7 days post-Dose 2 of Rotarix, sep-admin group
Tympanic membrane perforation – 21 days post-Dose 1 of Rotarix, sep-admin group
Gastroenteritis viral – 5 days post-Dose 2 of Rotarix, sep-admin group
Pyloric stenosis – 1 day post-Dose 1 of routine vaccine, sep-admin group
Pneumonia – 16 days post-Dose 3 of routine vaccine, sep-admin group
One case of intussusception was reported (separately-administered group) 90 days post-Dose 3 of
routine vaccination. Kawasaki’s disease was not reported.
The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 SAE in Rota-060 (6.1%) was comparable to Rota023 (5.6%) and lower than Rota-036 (10.96%) and Rota-006 (11.93%).
Intussusception within Day 0 - 30 post-vaccination – all BLA studies
The reviewer calculated incidence of IS post-vaccination in different onset intervals using data from
all BLA studies at all Rotarix potencies. Only data pertaining to the lyophilized formulation with
buffer was used for the Rotarix group calculations. Date of illness onset was used instead of date of
diagnosis, including IS cases for Rota-023.

Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (non-IS)
In a post-hoc Core ISS analysis, the applicant compared pooled rates of PTs categorized under
MedDRA High Level Term (HLT) Gastrointestinal hemorrhages between Rotarix and placebo
groups. When the PTs Diarrhoea hemorrhagic, Gastritis hemorrhagic, Gastrointestinal hemorrhage,
Hematochezia, Rectal hemorrhage, and Upper Gastrointestinal hemorrhage were combined, 19
(0.05%) Rotarix compared to 9 (0.03%) placebo subjects reported at least one of these AEs
(RR=1.22, 95% CI: 0.52-3.09). This imbalance was primarily driven by Hematochezia (Rotarix – 15,
placebo – 7). Of the 28 cases, 6 (Rotarix – 4, placebo – 2) were SAEs, summarized below:
Diarrhoea haemorrhagic (Rota-023, Nicaragua): 6 month male, 20 days post-Dose 1
Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (Rota-023, Mexico): 10 month female, 20 days post-Dose 2
Gastritis haemorrhagic (Rota-023, Mexico): 6 month female, 7 days post-Dose 2
Haematochezia (Rota-036, Finland): 11 month female, 499 days post-Dose 2
Haematochezia (Rota-007, Singapore): 13 month male, 31 days post-Dose 2 (placebo)
Rectal haemorrhage (Rota-023, Argentina): 6 month male, 139 days post-Dose 2 (placebo)
24 of the 28 cases (Rotarix – 17, placebo – 7) occurred within 31 days post-vaccination. Only 3 of
the 24 cases (Rotarix – 3, placebo – 0) during this interval were reported as SAEs.
Reviewer Note: The reviewer also looked at the same gastrointestinal hemorrhage-related PTs in
the Supplementary ISS groups. When the PTs Hematochezia, Melaena, and Rectal hemorrhage
were pooled, 5 Rotarix versus 1 placebo recipient reported at least 1 PT within 31 days postvaccination. There were no GI hemorrhage-related PTs categorized as SAEs within 31 days post-

221

vaccination, and only 2 cases of Hematochezia (Rotarix – 1, placebo – 1) were reported at any time
during the studies.
Kawasaki disease – BLA studies
Three BLA studies (Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-023) reported a total of 4 cases of Kawasaki disease.
All cases occurred in Rotarix recipients and were assessed as not related to vaccination. Cases are
summarized in the table below.

In general, grade 3 unsolicited AEs were infrequent. The following Grade 3 unsolicited AE PTs were
reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects:
SOC General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia (1.3%)
SOC Infections and infestations: Otitis media (1.2%)
Significant differences were observed for the following PTs:
SOC Infections and infestations
PT Bronchiolitis (Rotarix-0.12%, placebo-0.45%; RR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.09-0.81)
SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders
PT Rhinorrhoea (Rotarix-0.00%, placebo-0.24%; RR=0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.38)
There were no reports of grade 3 PT Hematochezia in either group.
Supplementary ISS analysis
Unsolicited AE, any intensity
A total of 1338 (43.5%) of Rotarix recipients and 667 (41.3%) of placebo recipients reported at least
one unsolicited AE of any intensity from Days 0-30 post-vaccination. The difference was not
significant (RR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.94-1.13). Significant differences between groups were not
observed for any SOC.
The following unsolicited AE PTs were reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects:
SOC Eye disorders: Conjunctivitis (1.5%)
SOC Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal pain (1.7%), Constipation (1.5%), Vomiting (1.1%)
SOC General disorders and administration site conditions: Irritability (2.9%), Pyrexia (4.0%)
SOC Infections and infestations: Acarodermatitis (1.2%), Bronchiolitis (1.1%), Bronchitis

224

(1.9%), Influenza (6.5%), Nasopharyngitis (3.6%), Oral candidiasis (1.2%), Otitis
media (1.3%), Rhinitis (2.0%), Upper respiratory tract infection (5.6%), Viral infection (3.8%)
SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Cough (3.6%), Rhinorrhoea (1.7%)
SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash (1.4%)
Significant differences were observed for the following PTs:
SOC Infections and infestations
PT Bronchitis (Rotarix-1.85%, placebo-0.74%; RR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.27-4.90)
SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders
PT Rhinorrhoea (Rotarix-1.69%, placebo-2.91%; RR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.91)
Reviewer Note: The applicant stated that the imbalance in PT Bronchitis was only driven by an
imbalance of bronchitis AEs in Rota-006. Based on the analysis dataset for Rota-006 (< 106.0
CCID50 groups), the reviewer obtained a total of 44 (3.9%) Rotarix recipients compared to 10 (1.8%)
placebo recipients who reported non-SAE PT Bronchitis from Days 0 to 30 post-vaccination. Grade
3 bronchitis occurred in 1 Rotarix compared to 0 placebo recipients. SAE PT Bronchitis was
reported in 4 Rotarix versus 0 placebo recipients during Days 0 to 30 post-vaccination. In the core
ISS analysis, when PTs Bronchitis and Bronchitis acute were combined, 116 (2.3%) Rotarix
recipients compared to 45 (1.6%) placebo subjects reported an AE during the same interval. Grade
3 bronchitis rates were comparable (0.16% versus 0.14%). In Rota-006, the rate of any PT
Bronchitis in the Rotarix group receiving the licensure potency dosage was higher than in the
placebo group (3.7% vs 1.8%); no Grade 3 or SAE PT Bronchitis was reported in this Rotarix group.
Despite a significantly higher rate of PT Bronchitis in the Rotarix group, significant differences in
other lower respiratory-related PTs (Bronchiolitis, Bronchopneumonia, Pneumonia, Lower
respiratory tract infection) were not observed. A significant difference in rate of PT Bronchitis
between groups was also not seen in the Core ISS analysis.
Unsolicited AE, grade 3 intensity
A total of 70 (2.28%) of Rotarix recipients and 37 (2.29%) of placebo recipients reported at least
one Grade 3 unsolicited AE from Days 0-30 post-vaccination. The difference was not significant
(RR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.64-1.48). Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were less common overall; there were no
Grade 3 AE PTs reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects. Significant differences were not observed for
the any SOCs or PTs, including PT Bronchitis.
Individual studies –Rota-036
Analyses of unsolicited AEs were previously reviewed in section 8.1.2.
Individual studies – Rota-005
Unsolicited AE, any intensity
A total of 264 subjects (105.6 CCID50-112 [52.8%], 106.8 CCID50-104 [49.8%], placebo-48 [44.4%])
reported at least one unsolicited AE of any intensity from Days 0-42 post-vaccination. Given the
small numbers of cases in many PTs, rates were similar between groups by PT. AE WHO PTs
reported in ≥ 1% and < 10% of Rotarix subjects were Contact dermatitis (both groups), Injection site
reaction (both groups), Fever (106.8 group), Injury (106.8 group), Heart disorder (106.8 group),
Abdominal pain (both groups), Constipation (both groups), Diarrhea (106.8 group), Flatulence (both
groups), Gastroesophageal reflux (both groups), Gastrointestinal disorder nos (both groups),
Toothache (both groups), Vomiting (106.8 group), Nervousness (both groups), Somnolence (both
groups), Viral infection (both groups), Moniliasis (both groups), Otitis media (105.6 group), Rhinitis

225

(106.8 group), Sinusitis (106.8 group), Eczema (both groups), Rash (both groups), Erythematous rash
(106.8 group), Seborrhea (106.8 group), and Conjunctivitis (both groups).
AE PTs reported in ≥ 10% of Rotarix subjects were Otitis media (106.8 group), Upper Respiratory
tract infection (both groups), Asthma (both groups), Bronchitis (105.6 group), Cough (106.8 group),
Pneumonia (both groups), Respiratory disorder (105.6 group),
48 subjects (105.6 CCID50-19 [9.0%], 106.8 CCID50-20 [9.6%], placebo-9 [8.3%]) reported at least one
vaccine-related unsolicited AE during this interval. Rates were similar between groups by PT.
Unsolicited AE, grade 3
A total of 32 subjects (105.6 CCID50-13[6.1%], 106.8 CCID50-11 [5.3%], placebo-8 [7.4%]) reported at
a grade 3 AE from Days 0-42 post-vaccination. Rates were similar between groups by PT. No
Grade 3 PTs were reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects.
Comparison with Rota-036 and Rota-006
The percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 unsolicited AE in the106.8 CCID50 group (49.8%)
was lower than that in the 106.6 CCID50 group in Rota-006 (60.7%) and the Rotarix group in Rota036 (63.7%, Day 0-30 post-dose).
Individual studies – Rota-033
Unsolicited AE, any intensity
A total of 432 subjects (Lot A-119 [49.0%], Lot B-119 [49.4%], Lot C-126 [51.2%], placebo-68
[54.8%]) reported at least one unsolicited AE of any intensity from Days 0-32 post-vaccination.
Given the small numbers of cases in many PTs, rates were similar between groups by PT. PTs
reported in ≥ 1% and < 10% of Rotarix subjects were Conjunctivitis (Lot B, Lot C), Abdominal pain
(all lots), Constipation (Lot A), Pyrexia (Lot A, Lot B), Bronchitis (all lots), Acute bronchitis (all lots),
Candidiasis (Lot C), Impetigo (Lot A), Influenza (all lots), Pharyngitis (all lots), Respiratory tract
infection (Lot B), Tonsillitis (Lot A, Lot C), Tracheitis (Lot B), Upper respiratory tract infection (all
lots), Bronchospasm (all lots), Cough (Lot B), Rhinitis (Lot A, Lot C), Dermatitis (all lots), Allergic
dermatitis (Lot A, Lot C), Atopic dermatitis (Lot C), and Contact dermatitis (Lot B). Only PT
Nasopharyngitis (all lots) was reported in ≥ 10% of Rotarix subjects.
Four AEs were assessed as related to vaccination:
Grade 1 Abdominal pain- 12 days post-Dose 2, Lot A
Grade 1 Dehydration- 2 days post-Dose 2, Lot A
Grade 1 Abdominal pain – 23 days post-Dose 2, Lot C
Grade 1 Nasopharyngitis – 3 days post-Dose 1, placebo
Unsolicited AE, Grade 3 intensity
Only 2 subjects (Lot B-1, Lot C-1) reported a grade 3 unsolicited AE from Days 0-30 postvaccination. Both were assessed as related to vaccination as follows:
Grade 3 Influenza – 12 days post-Dose 1, Lot B
Grade 3 Influenza – 18 days post-Dose 1, Lot C
Individual studies – Rota-060
Unsolicited AE, any intensity
A total of 57 subjects (co-adm group-27 [10.8%], sep-admin group-30 [12.8%]) reported at least one
unsolicited AE during the study period. Given the small numbers of cases in many PTs, rates were
similar between groups by PT. The only significant imbalance observed between groups was for PT
Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (co-adm group-0, sep-admin group-5 [2.1%], p=0.021). Of these

226

5 subjects, 2 had onset on the day of Dose 2 of routine vaccines, 1 had onset on the day of Dose 2
of Rotarix, 1 had onset 15 days post-Dose 1 of Rotarix, and 1 had onset 9 days post-Dose 2 of
Rotarix. All were Grade 1 in intensity and not assessed as causally due to vaccination. The
applicant concluded that this imbalance was likely due to a chance observation.
Other AE MedDRA PTs reported in ≥ 1% and < 3% of Rotarix subjects were Pyrexia (sep-ad
group), Otitis Media (both groups), Upper respiratory tract infection (co-ad group), Viral infection
(co-ad group), and Eczema (sep-ad group).
Only one AE was assessed as related to vaccination:
Grade 2 Pyrexia – 1 day post-Dose 1 of routine vaccines, sep-ad group
Unsolicited AE, Grade 3 intensity
Only 4 subjects (co-ad group -3, sep-ad group -1) reported a grade 3 unsolicited AE during the
study period. No grade 3 AE was related to vaccination. The 4 AE PTs were Bronchiolitis, Otitis
media, Pneumonia, and Viral infection.
10.3.3

Dropouts

Core ISS analysis
The percentages of Rotarix and placebo subjects who dropped out due to a non-SAE or SAE were
similar between groups (Rotarix-0.43%, placebo-0.39%). For each study, there were no significant
differences in dropout rates between treatment groups by PT. The majority of AEs were judged as
not related to vaccination. Vaccine-related AEs were previously reviewed for Rota-006, Rota-023,
and Rota-036 (see sections 8.1.1, 8.1.2, and 8.1.4). Among the other studies in the Core ISS, there
were no reported vaccine-related AEs leading to dropout.
Overall rates of dropout were similar between groups in each study, given the small numbers (note:
Rota-007 had 3 dropouts in the Rotarix group only, Rota-033 had 4 dropouts in the Rotarix group
only). The vast majority of subjects in each study dropped out because of the following: consent
withdrawal (not due to an AE), migration from study area, or lost to follow-up.
Supplementary ISS analysis
The percentages of Rotarix and placebo subjects who dropped out due to a non-SAE or SAE were
similar between groups (Rotarix-0.58%, placebo-0.62%). There were no significant differences
dropout rates between treatment groups by PT. Most of the AEs were judged as not related to
vaccination. Vaccine-related AEs were previously reviewed for Rota-004 and Rota-006 (see
sections 8.1.3 and 8.1.4). Among the other studies in the Supplementary ISS, there were no
vaccine-related AEs leading to dropout.
Overall dropout rates were similar between groups in each study. The vast majority of subjects in
each study dropped out because of the following: consent withdrawal (not due to an AE), migration
from study area, or lost to follow-up.
Rota-005
One subject (106.8 CCID50 group) dropped out due to an SAE (Gastroesophageal reflux). Five
subjects (105.6 CCID50-2, 106.8 CCID50-2, placebo-1) dropped out due to a non-SAE (grade 3
Lethargy, Fussiness/Vomiting, grade 1 Hepatomegaly, grade 2 Body rash, and grade 3
Diarrhea/Vomiting/Fever). All AEs leading to dropout were judged as not related to vaccination, and
are briefly described below.
Grade 2 Gastroesophageal reflux – 7 days post-Dose 1, 106.8 CCID50 group
Grade 1 Hepatomegaly – 45 days post-Dose 1, 106.8 CCID50 group
Grade 3 Diarrhea/Vomiting/Fever – 16 days post-Dose 1, 106.8 CCID50 group
Grade 3 Lethargy – 7 days post-Dose 1, 105.6 CCID50 group

227

Fussiness/Vomiting – during solicited period post-Dose 1, 105.6 CCID50 group
Grade 2 Body rash – 61 days post-Dose 1, placebo
Most of the subjects who dropped out did so because they withdrew consent (not due to an AE),
migrated from the study area or were lost to follow-up (105.6 CCID50-84%, 106.8 CCID50-87%,
placebo-70%).
Rota-033
Three subjects (Lot A-1, Lot B-1, Lot C-1) dropped out due to vaccine-unrelated SAE deaths, which
were described previously in section 10.3.1. One non-SAE (Grade 3 Diarrhea with vaccine strain
isolated, post-Dose 1, vaccine-related) was reported post-Dose 1 following receipt of Lot A Rotarix.
Most of the subjects dropped out because they withdrew consent (not due to an AE), migrated from
the study area or were lost to follow-up (Lot A-71%, Lot B-81%, Lot C-90, placebo-92%).
Rota-060
Only 1 subject (sep-admin group) dropped out due to an SAE (Atypical rhabdoid tumor, 3 days
post-Dose 1 of routine vaccine, vaccine-unrelated). No dropouts due to non-SAEs were reported.
Most of the subjects who dropped out did so because they withdrew consent (not due to an AE),
migrated from the study area or were lost to follow-up.
Reviewer note: In the Rota-060 Study Report, the applicant stated that 417 of the 484 total
subjects completed the Active Phase of the study (i.e. up to Visit 6). However, in the Annex Report
1, which contained the final safety data, the applicant noted that 432 of the 484 subjects completed
the extended safety follow-up phase (i.e. 11 months of age).

AE Incidence Tables (Systemic Events)

Solicited general AEs – Day 0 to Day 7 post-vaccination
Core ISS analysis
A total of 3286 Rotarix recipients and 2015 placebo recipients had a completed solicited AE
CRF/eCRF. Compliance was high (>98%) in each group for subjects who returned AE diary cards
after each dose.
Solicited AEs, any intensity
The rates of each AE symptom, regardless of intensity, after each dose and after any dose are
summarized in the table below. Rates of each AE after Dose 1, Dose 2, and any dose were similar
between groups; all 95% CIs included 1.0. In both groups, fussiness/irritability was the most common
AE, followed by cough/runny nose, fever, and loss of appetite. Symptoms reported in ≥ 10% of
Rotarix subjects after any dose were fever, fussiness/irritability, loss of appetite, vomiting, and
cough/runny nose. Diarrhea was reported in 6.82% of Rotarix subjects after any dose.

Among individual studies, the following symptoms with a 95% CI (of the RR) that excluded
1.0 were observed:
Rota-005: any vomiting post-Dose 2 (RR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.19-0.99)
Rota-036: any vomiting post-Dose 2 (RR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.91)
Solicited AEs, Grade 3 intensity
The rates of Grade 3 individual AE symptoms are summarized below. Overall, Grade 3 symptoms
were less frequent, and rates were similar between groups after each dose and after any dose. The
exception was cough/runny nose after any dose, which was slightly but statistically significantly

229

higher in the Rotarix group (RR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.01-1.99). However, rates of cough/runny nose
after each dose were not significantly different between groups. Grade 3 symptoms reported in ≥
1% and <10% of Rotarix subjects after any dose were fever, fussiness/irritability, vomiting, diarrhea,
and cough/runny nose.

For individual studies, the following symptoms with a RR 95% CI that excluded 1.0 were observed:

230

Rota-005: grade 3 loss of appetite post-Dose 1 (RR=0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.98)
Rota-039: grade 3 vomiting post-Dose 2 (RR=0.10, 95% CI: 0.01-0.70) and post-any
dose (RR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.06-0.88)
Supplementary ISS analysis
A total of 3028 Rotarix recipients and 1588 placebo recipients had a completed solicited AE
CRF/eCRF. Compliance was high (>98%) among subjects in each group who returned AE diary
cards after each dose.
Solicited AEs, any intensity
The rates for each AE symptom of any intensity after Dose 1, Dose 2, and any dose were similar
between groups when subjects from all studies were pooled, with all 95% CIs of RRs including 1.0.
Among individual studies, the following symptoms with a 95% CI that excluded 1.0 were observed:
Rota-004: any loss of appetite post-Dose 2 (RR=1.67; 95% CI: 1.02-2.81) and post-any dose
(RR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.07-2.17)
Rota-007: any fussiness/irritability post-Dose 1 (RR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.06-1.43)
Solicited AEs, grade 3 intensity
The rates for each AE symptom of grade 3 intensity after each dose and after any dose were similar
between groups when subjects from all studies were pooled, with all 95% CIs including 1.0. Grade
3 AEs were less common overall. Among individual studies, no RR estimates with 95% CIs that
excluded 1.0 were observed.
Individual studies – Rota-005 (Phase II, US and Canada)
Grade 2 or 3 fever, vomiting, or diarrhea – Day 0 to 14
The percentage of subjects who reported Grade 2/3 fever, vomiting, or diarrhea during the 15-day
post-vaccination period was similar between groups after each dose. There was no statistically
significant difference in percentages between either Rotarix versus placebo.
Solicited AEs – Day 0 to 14
For each solicited symptom (cough/runny nose, diarrhea, irritability, loss of appetite, fever,
vomiting), the rates of subjects who reported a symptom of any intensity, a grade 2 or 3 symptom, a
grade 3 symptom, or a vaccine-related symptom were similar between groups after any dose.
Irritability was the most common symptom, followed by cough/runny nose and loss of appetite.
Grade 3 events were less common. For each symptom, statistically significant differences in rates
were not seen between each Rotarix group versus placebo and between Rotarix groups. The
exception was vomiting, which occurred less frequently in the 106.8 CCID50 group (16.3%) compared
to placebo (25%) (p=0.072, significance level of alpha=0.1).
Symptoms that were reported in ≥ 10% of Rotarix subjects in both groups after any dose were
fever, fussiness/irritability, loss of appetite, vomiting, and cough/runny nose. Diarrhea was reported
in 11.0% of Rotarix subjects in the 106.8 group and 8.5% in the 105.6 group. Grade 3 symptoms
reported in ≥ 1% and <10% of Rotarix subjects were cough/runny nose (both groups), diarrhea
(105.6 group), loss of appetite (106.8 group), fever (105.6 group), and vomiting (both groups). Only
Grade 3 irritability was reported in ≥ 10% of Rotarix subjects (both groups).

231

Individual studies – Rota-033 (Phase III, lot-to-lot consistency, Latin America)
Solicited AEs – Day 0 to 7
For each solicited symptom (diarrhea, irritability, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting), the rates of
subjects who reported any symptom of any intensity, a grade 3 symptom, or a vaccine-related
symptom were similar between groups after any dose. Irritability was the most common symptom,
followed by loss of appetite and fever. Grade 3 events were uncommon. For each symptom at each
subcategory (any, grade 3, vaccine-related), statistically significant differences in rates were not
seen between Lot A versus Lot B, Lot A versus Lot C, or Lot B versus Lot C.
Symptoms that were reported in ≥ 10% of Rotarix subjects in all lots after Dose 1 were irritability,
loss of appetite, vomiting, and fever. Diarrhea was reported in 5.8% of subjects from Lot A, 5.4% of
subjects from Lot B, and 6.1% of subjects from Lot C. Grade 3 symptoms reported in ≥ 1% and
<10% of Rotarix subjects were irritability (Lots A, B), diarrhea (Lots A, B), and vomiting (all lots).
Symptoms that were reported in ≥ 10% of Rotarix subjects in all lots after Dose 2 were irritability,
loss of appetite, vomiting, and fever. Diarrhea was reported in 6.8% of subjects from Lot A, 5.4% of
subjects from Lot B, and 3.3% of subjects from Lot C. Grade 3 symptoms reported in ≥ 1% and
<10% of Rotarix subjects were irritability (all lots) and vomiting (all lots).
Individual studies – Rota-036 (pivotal Phase III, Europe)
Reactogenicity findings were reported in detail in section 8.1.2. There were no significant safety
signals from Day 0 to Day 7 post-vaccination.

Laboratory Findings, Concomitant Medications

Genetic stability of RV vaccine strain
Sequencing analyses of the entire genome of the vaccine virus RIX4414 from 18 clinical stool
samples (from 5 subjects with diarrhea, 6 subjects who may have acquired vaccine virus via nonvaccination transmission, and 7 asymptomatic subjects who were part of planned stool testing)
indicated that VP4, VP7 and NSP4 were nearly always the only variable proteins. There was no
clear association between amino acid substitutions in these proteins and either duration of virus
shedding or GE. In Rota-039, no mutations in the VP4, VP87, and NSP4 genes were seen in
vaccine RV antigen from 2 GE stool samples of Rotarix recipients. Sequencing analyses of vaccine
RV antigen from the 6 non-vaccinated subjects indicated that a second replication cycle did not
increase the mutation rate, and the new mutations were not associated with a virulent phenotype.
Concomitant medications post-vaccination
The percentages of subjects in each group that received any medication, antipyretic, prophylactic
antipyretic, and antibiotic during the post-vaccination period were calculated in each study except
Rota-023. The post-vaccination period was defined as either Days 0-7 (Rota-033, Rota-036), Days
0-14 (Rota-004, Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-014, Rota-039, Rota-048), or any time during
the active phase (Day 0 to Month 5) of the study (Rota-060).
Overall, the percentages of subjects in each of the 4 categories were similar between groups.
Frequencies in each category varied across studies, and correlations between type of co-

234

administered routine vaccine (DTwP-containing vaccines, DTaP-containing vaccines) and
frequencies of medication use were not observed.
10.4.3

Product-Demographic Interactions

Age, gender
Age at Dose 1 and gender distribution were similar across all studies. The only exceptions were in
Rota-007 and Rota-036, where the median age at Dose 1 was higher than in other studies (13
weeks and 12 weeks, respectively).

235

Ethnicity/race
The vast majority of subjects in each study were categorized into one of the major ethnic/racial
group as follows:
Asian/Oriental: Rota-007, Rota-038
Black: Rota-014
White/Caucasian: Rota-004, Rota-005, Rota-036, Rota-048, Rota-060
Hispanic: Rota-023, Rota-033
Other/Mixed: Rota-006
From the data on solicited events presented in the sections Comparison across studies in the Core
ISS and Comparison across studies in the Supplementary ISS, consistently higher rates of fever,
diarrhea, cough/runny nose and irritability were seen in Rota-006, a study in which the majority of
subjects were of mixed ancestry. However, rates of these 4 symptoms were similar across study
groups. In each country (Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela), rates of these symptoms were similar between
treatment groups, except for diarrhea which occurred less in the 105.6 CCID50 group in Mexico. When
stratified by race (Mixed, White, Black), rates were also similar between treatment groups, except for
diarrhea which occurred less in the 106.6 CCID50 group in the Black subjects compared to Black placebo
subjects. Rates of cough, diarrhea, and fever were the highest in Brazil across treatment groups, while
rates of irritability were the lowest in Venezuela. Across treatment groups, rates of diarrhea and
irritability were the lowest in White subjects, while rates of fever were the lowest in Black subjects.
In Rota-023, a proportionally higher number of deaths, pneumonia deaths, non-fatal pneumonia
SAEs, and overall SAEs during Dose 1 to Visit 3 occurred in Brazil and in subjects of mixed
ancestry. In Rota-033, a proportionally higher number of subjects who reported at least one
solicited and unsolicited AEs after any dose was reported in Peru. However, in both studies,
proportions of subjects in these ethnic/geographical subsets in each of these clinical AE categories
were similar between Rotarix and placebo groups. Across studies, consistent and noticeable trends
were not observed in frequencies of deaths, SAEs, or non-SAEs according to ethnicity/race.
Pre-term infants
Rota-023, Rota-033, and Rota-039 did not have any gestational age and/or birth weight exclusion
criteria, while Rota-006 and Rota-036 included subjects with a birth weight > 2000 grams. The other
studies (Rota-004, Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-014, and Rota-048) only enrolled subjects
who were born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation.
To identify any safety issues in pre-term infants, the applicant conducted a post-hoc analysis for
Rota-023 by first identifying infants with a gestational age of ≤ 36 weeks reported in the “preexisting medication conditions” section of the CRF. Precise gestational ages that were not recorded
in the CRF were confirmed by the investigator.
A total of 254 pre-term infants were identified (Rotarix-134, placebo-120). The median gestational
age in each group was 35.0 weeks (range: 29-36 weeks for Rotarix, 28-36 weeks for placebo). All
infants were vaccinated according to their chronological age, and were followed for safety from
Dose 1 to Visit 3. Thirteen pre-term infants (Rotarix-7, 5.2%; placebo-6, 5.0%) reported at least one
SAE; the differences in overall rates and rates by individual PT between groups were not
statistically significant. Only the SAE PT Bronchiolitis was reported in ≥ 1% of Rotarix subjects (3
subjects, 2.2%). No fatalities or IS cases were reported in either group.
Fifty-two subjects (Rotarix-29, placebo-23) were part of the Year 1 efficacy subset and followed up
to 1 year of age. The median gestational age in each group was 35.0 weeks (range: 33-36 weeks

236

for Rotarix, 29-36 weeks for placebo). A total of 10 pre-term infants (Rotarix-5, placebo-5) reported
at least one SAE from after Visit 3 until Visit 4 (i.e. 1 year of age). Overall SAE rates and rates by
SAE PT were not significantly different between groups. PTs reported in the Rotarix group were
Bronchiolitis (1 subject), Bronchitis (1 subject), Diarrhea infectious (1 subject), Gastroenteritis (2
subjects), and Pneumonia (1 subject).
Of note, none of the pre-term infants in the Rotarix group had blood tests for immunogenicity.
Severe RV GE occurred in one infant in each group (Rotarix – G2P[4], placebo- G1 type).
Reviewer Note: The applicant did not state whether pre-term infants were actually enrolled in Rota033 and Rota-039.
10.4.4

Product-Disease Interactions

All vaccinated subjects were healthy at enrollment. However, in Rota-014, inclusion of HIV-positive
infants was discovered retrospectively from investigations of fatal cases. During Part 1 of the study,
6 of 7 subjects who died were HIV positive. Among the 7 deaths, 3 (1.7%) were Rotarix recipients
and 4 (4.4%) were placebo recipients. All fatalities were judged as not related to vaccination, and
most of the deaths were due to HIV-related opportunistic infections. Subsequent to this
investigation, maternal HIV status was ascertained in order to enroll only subjects whose mothers
tested HIV negative for Part 2 of the study.
The applicant also performed HIV testing on blood samples collected from the remaining 265
subjects in Part 1. Of the 172 subjects who provided consent, 5 subjects tested HIV positive
(Rotarix-2, placebo-3). No SAEs were reported in these 5 subjects and all unsolicited AEs were
mild or moderate in intensity. None of these subjects demonstrated anti-RV IgA seroconversion
post-Dose 2.
Based on limited data provided above, the applicant concluded that Rotarix administration did not
raise any safety concerns in HIV-positive subjects.
10.4.5

Product-Product Interactions

Concomitant administration of routine pediatric vaccines
Concomitant administration of routine pediatric vaccines with Rotarix or placebo was allowed in all
studies except Rota-004 and Rota-048. Rota-006 and Rota-036 have been reviewed in detail in
sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.4, and were part of the Core and/or Supplementary ISS analyses. Other
studies have also been reviewed in this safety overview section, as part of the Core and
Supplementary ISS analyses and also individually (Rota-005, Rota-033).
The proportion of TVC subjects in each study who were co-administered routine vaccines with Dose
1 and Dose 2 of Rotarix or placebo is summarized as follows:
Rota-005: >94% of US subjects and >93% of Canadian subjects in each group received
routine vaccines (US: Infanrix, OmniHIB or ActHIB [or Comvax], Prevnar, IPOL;
Canada: Pentacel) with Dose 1 and Dose 2
Rota-006: > 98% of subjects in each group received DTPw-HB+Hib vaccine with Dose 1
and Dose 2; OPV administered 2 weeks apart from Rotarix or placebo
Rota-007: >98% of subjects in each group received DTPa-IPV/HiB with Dose 1 and
Dose 2; no subjects received HBV together with Dose 1 of Rotarix or placebo, while
only 5 subjects received HBV with Dose 2

237

Rota-014: not specifically noted in the study report; subjects were to have received
either DTPa/Hib + OPV or DTPa-IPV/Hib with each study dose
Rota-023: only 6% of subjects received routine vaccinations with Dose 1 (DTPw- 3.343.4%, Hib – 3.0%, HBV- 5.1-5.3%); 3% of subjects received routine vaccinations with
Dose 2 (DTPw- 2.9-3.0%, Hib – 2.4%, HBV – 1.8-1.9%); OPV administered 2 weeks
apart from Rotarix or placebo)
Rota-036: 98.5-100% of subjects in each group received DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, Prevenar, and
Meningitec with Dose 1; 99.7-100% of placebo received routine vaccinations with Dose 2
Rota-039: ≥ 95% of subjects in each group received Infanrix IPV Hib with Dose 1 and Dose 2
Rota-060: All subjects (N=249) in the Co-Ad group received Pediarix, Prevnar, and
ActiHIB with Rotarix (232/249 subjects received both doses of Rotarix)
Safety – Adverse Events
As mentioned previously in this safety overview section, rates of AEs (deaths, SAEs, non-SAEs,
concomitant medications) were similar between groups in each study. Safety data indicated that
there appeared to be no clear correlation between co-administration of routine vaccines with Rotarix
and increased frequencies of AEs. The only exception appeared to the frequency of fever of any
intensity from Days 0-7, which among the Core ISS Analysis studies, was lower after each dose
and after any dose in Rotarix recipients from Rota-048 (in which no co-administration of routine
vaccines were allowed) than among Rotarix subjects in each of the other studies. However,
because rates were similar between Rotarix and placebo groups in each study that allowed coadministration of routine vaccines, the higher rates of fever in the these studies compared to Rota048 was likely attributable to the co-administered routine vaccines. Furthermore, rates of Grade 3
fever were much less frequent across all studies. In the Supplementary ISS Analysis, rates of any
fever from Days 0- 7 post-vaccination in subjects from Rota-004 (co-administration not allowed)
were generally lower than those in other studies except Rota-014. Again, rates Grade 3 fever
were lower across all studies.
Immune response to concomitant vaccine antigens
Immunogenicity of co-administered vaccinations was evaluated in all or a subset of subjects from
Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-014, Rota-036, and Rota-060.
Rota-006 and Rota-036
The immunogenicity of co-administered vaccine antigens in Rota-006 and Rota-036 were reviewed
in sections 8.1.4 and 8.1.2. In both studies, there were no significant differences between treatment
groups in seroprotection rates, seropositivity rates, or GMC/GMTs to any of the vaccine antigens
that did not favor any of the Rotarix groups. Although there appeared to be no impact of Rotarix at
any potency on the immune responses to co-administered antigens at selected post-Dose 2 of
Rotarix (post-Dose 3 of routine vaccines) time points, clinical limits for non-inferiority for each of the
routine antigens were not pre-defined.
For Rota-036, the applicant also performed a post-hoc immunogenicity analysis of the Spain subset
to demonstrate non-inferiority of Rotarix compared to placebo for each co-administered routine
vaccine antigen. The Spain subset was chosen due the same routine vaccines (DTaP-HepB-IPV)
given at the same schedule (2, 4, and 6 months). For the difference in seroprotection rates
between groups (i.e. placebo minus Rotarix) for each antigen, non-inferiority was met if the UL of
the 95% CI of the rate difference was < 10%. Based on this definition, Rotarix was inferior to
placebo for seroprotection against anti-poliovirus type 2 (UL=10.81%) (see table below).

Reviewer Note: Based on FDA non-inferiority criteria for anti-polio response (UL of the 95% CI of
the rate difference ≤ 5%), Rotarix was also inferior to placebo for seroprotection against antipoliovirus type 3 (UL = 5.66%).
Reviewer Note: Figures in the table above are different that those in the Rota-036 Study Report.
For the ratio of GMCs between groups (i.e. placebo/Rotarix) for pertussis and pneumococcal
antigens, non-inferiority was met if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the GMC ratio was <1.5 for the
pertussis antigens. Based on these criteria, Rotarix was not inferior to placebo for GMCs against
any of the antigens (see table below).

Routine vaccine immunogenicity was evaluated as a secondary study objective and measured at
Visit 2 (2 months post-study Dose1), Visit 3 (2 months post-study Dose 2), and Visit 4 (6-8 months
post-routine Dose 3). Seroprotection or seropopositivity for each antigen was defined as follows:
Anti-pneumococcal (7 serotypes):
Anti-PRP:
Anti-diphtheria:

≥ 0.05 μg/mL (≥ 2.0 μg/mL also measured)
≥ 0.15 μg/mL, ≥ 1.0 μg/mL

Clinical limits for non-inferiority of Rotarix compared to placebo for each of the routine antigens
were not pre-defined for these studies in the original protocol.
In the ATP immunogenicity cohort, >95% of US subjects received 2 doses of routine vaccines
between Visit 1 and Visit 3. Among US subjects with available anti-D, anti-T, anti-PT, anti-FHA,
anti-PRN and anti-pneumococcal antibody results at Visit 4, >91% of subjects in each group
(105.6CCID50, 106.8CCID50, placebo) received 3 doses of DTPa and Prevnar between Visit 1 (i.e.
Dose 1) and before Visit 4. For subjects with available anti-PRP results at Visit 4, 86-89% of
subjects in each group received 3 doses of Hib vaccine between Visit 1 and before Visit 4. For
subjects with available anti-polio results at Visit 4, 52-54% of subjects in each group received 3
doses of Hib vaccine between Visit 1 and before Visit 4.
In the ATP immunogenicity cohort, >93% of Canadian subjects received 2 doses of routine
vaccines between Visit 1 and Visit 3. Among Canadian subjects with available routine vaccine
serology results at Visit 4, >83% of subjects in each group received 3 doses of Pentacel between
Visit 1 and before Visit 4.
Immunogenicity analyses included only subjects who received at least 2 doses of routine vaccine
antigens between Visit 1 and before Visit 4. For each routine antigen, seroprotection/seropositivity
rates and GMCs/GMTs at Visit 4 were similar between either of the Rotarix (105.6CCID50 and
106.8CCID50) and placebo groups in the ATP immunogenicity cohort. Immunogenicity at Visit 3
was also similar between groups.
The applicant also performed a post-hoc analysis of the US subset to demonstrate non-inferiority of
Rotarix (106.8CCID50 potency) compared to placebo for each co-administered routine vaccine
antigen. For the difference in seroprotection rates between groups (i.e. placebo minus Rotarix) for
each antigen, non-inferiority was met if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the rate difference was <
10%. Based on this definition, Rotarix was not inferior to placebo for seroprotection against any of
the antigens (see table below).

Reviewer Note: Based on FDA-suggested non-inferiority criteria for anti-polio response (UL of the
95% CI of the rate difference ≤ 5%), Rotarix was inferior to placebo for seroprotection against antipolio type 2 (UL = 6.50%).
For the ratio of GMCs between groups (i.e. placebo/Rotarix) for pertussis and pneumococcal
antigens, non-inferiority was met if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the GMC ratio was < 2.0 for the
pneumococcal antigens and <1.5 for the pertussis antigens. Based on these criteria, Rotarix was
inferior to placebo for GMC against PT (UL=1.65), PRN (UL=1.62), and S. pneumoniae type 14
(UL=2.06) (see table below).

Reviewer Note: Based on FDA-suggested non-inferiority criteria for GMT ratios for S. pneumoniae
antigens (UL of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio ≤ 1.5), Rotarix was also inferior to placebo for GMC
against S. pneumoniae type 6B (UL=1.84) and type 19F (UL=1.52).
Rota-007
Routine vaccine immunogenicity was evaluated as a secondary objective and measured at Visit 4
(2 months post-study Dose 2, 1 month post-routine Dose 3). Seroprotection or seropopositivity for
each antigen was defined as follows:
Anti-PRP:
Anti-diphtheria:

≥ 0.15 μg/mL, ≥ 1.0 μg/mL
≥ 0.1 IU/mL

241

Anti-tetanus:
Anti-PRN:
Anti-FHA:
Anti-PT:
Anti-polio (1, 2, 3):
Anti-HBs:

≥ 0.1 IU/mL
≥ 5 EL.U/mL
≥ 5 EL.U/mL
≥ 5 EL.U/mL
≥ 8 ED50
≥ 10 mIU/ml

Clinical limits for non-inferiority of Rotarix compared to placebo for each routine antigen were not
pre-defined for these studies in the original protocol.
Among subjects in the ATP immunogenicity cohort with available routine vaccine serology results at
Visit 4, >96% of subjects in each of the groups (105.3 CCID50, 105.6 CCID50, 106.6 CCID50, placebo)
received DTPa-IPV/Hib concomitantly with both doses of Rotarix or placebo and received 3 doses of
DTPa-IPV/Hib between Visit 1 and before Visit 4. Also, among these same subjects, >91% in each
group received one dose of HBV between Visit 1 and before Visit 4.
Immunogenicity analyses included only subjects who received at least 2 doses of routine vaccine
antigens between Visit 1 and before Visit 4. For each routine antigen, seroprotection/seropositivity
rates and GMCs/GMTs at Visit 4 were similar between any of the 3 Rotarix groups and placebo.
Statistical analyses of the rate differences and between placebo and each Rotarix group
demonstrated that there were no significant differences between the groups in seroprotection or
seropositivity rates for each antigen (95% CIs for each of the rate differences included 1.0).
Similarly, GMC or GMT ratios showed that there were no significant differences between groups in
GMCs or GMTs for each antigen (95% CIs for each of the ratios included 0).
Reviewer Note: Although the applicant did not define clinical limits for non-inferiority, based on
FDA criteria, Rotarix did not demonstrate inferiority to placebo for seroprotection/seropositivity rates
or GMCs/GMTs against any of the routine vaccine antigens.
Rota-014
The primary study objective was to demonstrate that co-administration of Rotarix with OPV does
not decrease anti-polio immune response one month post-Dose 3 of polio vaccine. Immunogenicity
against polioviruses types 1, 2, and 3 were measured at 1 month post-Dose 3 of polio vaccination in
3 groups: Rotarix (105.6CCID50) + OPV, Rotarix (105.6CCID50) + IPV, and placebo + OPV. The study
was comprised of 2 parts, Part 1 and Part 2, with the 3 groups represented in each part.
Seroprotection was defined as anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 antibodies each ≥ 8 ED50. Seroprotection rates
and GMTs were calculated for each group in Part 1, Part 2, and Parts 1 and 2 combined. The study
objective was met if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in the seroprotection rate of the
pooled group (Rotarix-IPV and placebo-OPV, Parts 1 and 2) minus the Rotarix-OPV group was ≤
10% for each polio serotype.
Although the ATP immunogenicity cohort was used for the primary analyses, only about 50% of the
cohort subjects were included in the analyses due to insufficient amount of serum. Also, subjects
included in the analysis may have already received a dose of OPV prior to enrollment because OPV
vaccination at birth was allowed in subjects according to the EPI.
Seroprotection rates against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were 100% in all groups except the HRVOPV and placebo-OPV groups, both of which had seroprotection rates of 98.0 and 98.4%,
respectively, against polio type 3. The upper limits of the 95% CI for the rate difference between the
pooled group and Rotarix-OPV group were <10% against each of the poliovirus types (type 1=
6.9%; type 2= 6.9%; type 3= 9.7%), thus demonstrating non-inferiority based on study criteria.

242

Reviewer Note: Based on FDA-suggested criteria for non-inferiority (UL 95% CI difference ≤ 5%),
Rotarix did not demonstrate non-inferiority for seroprotection against any of the polio types.
However, because the applicant did not define clinical limits for non-inferiority, the study was likely
not adequately powered to demonstrate non-inferiority using FDA-suggested criteria. In addition,
the polio vaccination schedule for this study (2, 3, and 4 months) is different than the US schedule
(2, 4, and 6 months).
The placebo-OPV/Rotarix-OPV and Rotarix-IPV/Rotarix-OPV GMT ratios also indicated that there were
no statistically significant differences in GMTs between the groups for all polio types, since 95% CIs of
the ratios included 1.0. The only exception was the Rotarix-IPV/Rotarix-OPV polio type 3 GMT ratio
(2.8), the 95% CI of which did not include 1.0 (1.8-4.6).
Rota-060
The primary objective of the US study was to demonstrate that co-administration of Rotarix
(106.5CCID50) with Pediarix (DTaP-IPV-Hep B), Prevnar, and ActHIB does not impair the immune
responses to each of these routine vaccine antigens at one month post-Dose 3 of routine
vaccinations (approximately 7 months of age). Healthy subjects 6-12 weeks of age were randomly
assigned to one of the following treatment groups:
-

2 doses of Rotarix co-administered with routine vaccines (co-ad group)
2 doses of Rotarix administered 1 month apart from routine vaccines (sep-ad group)

Subjects previously vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliovirus, Hib, or S.
pneumoniae, or those with histories of these diseases (plus hepatitis B), were excluded from the
study. Subjects who received only one dose of Hep B vaccine at least 30 days prior to enrolment
were included in the study.
GMC or GMT was measured for all antigens. Seroprotection or seropositivity for each antigen was
defined as follows:
Anti-PRP:
Anti-HBs:
Anti-polio (serotypes 1, 2, 3):
Anti-diphtheria:
Anti-tetanus:
Anti-PRN:
Anti-FHA:
Anti-PT:
Anti-S. pneumoniae:
(serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F)

≥ 1.0 μg/mL
≥ 10 mIU/ml
≥ 1:8
≥ 0.1 IU/mL
≥ 0.1 IU/mL
≥ 5 EL.U/mL
≥ 5 EL.U/mL
≥ 5 EL.U/mL
≥ 0.05 μg/mL (≥ 2.0 μg/mL also measured)

Demonstration of non-inferiority of the co-ad group in terms of immune response to routine vaccine
antigens required meeting all of the following criteria:
-

Lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI on the difference in anti-PRP seroprotection rates (co-ad group
minus sep-ad group) ≥ -10%
LL of the 95% CI on the difference in anti-HBs seroprotection rates (co-ad group minus sep-ad
group) ≥ -10%
LL of the 95% CI on the difference in anti-poliovirus seroprotection rates (co-ad group minus
sep-ad group) for serotypes 1, 2, and 3 ≥ -10%

243

-

LL of the 95% CI on the difference in anti-diphtheria seroprotection rates (co-ad group minus
sep-ad group) ≥ -10%
LL of the 95% CI on the difference in anti-tetanus seroprotection rates (co-ad group minus sepad group) ≥ -10%
LL of the 95% CI on the anti-pertussis GMC ratios (co-ad group divided by sep-ad group) for
PT, FHA, and PRN ≥ 0.67
LL of the 95% CI on the anti-S. pneumoniae GMC ratios (co-ad group divided by sep-ad group)
for each of the seven serotypes ≥ 0.5

Reviewer Note: These criteria are consistent with FDA-suggested non-inferiority criteria post-Dose
3 at 7 months of age except for anti-polio (FDA-suggested: LL of 95% CI≥ -5%) and anti-S.
pneumoniae non-inferiority (FDA-suggested: LL of 95% CI ≥ 2/3).
Based on a sample size of 200 in each group, alpha=0.025, reference rate estimates for
seroprotection endpoints or standard deviation estimates for GMC endpoints for each antigen, and
limits of non-inferiority for each antigen mentioned above, the study had 90% power overall to meet
the primary objective. Except for anti-PRP (92% power) and anti-PRN (99% power) endpoints, all
the other endpoints each had 100% power to meet the non-inferiority criterion for that endpoint.
A total of 317 subjects (co-ad group-180, sep-ad group-137) were included in the ATP
immunogenicity cohort. Demographic characteristics were similar between the groups. The
percentage of subjects who received a dose of Hep B vaccine before Visit 1 was similar (co-ad
group-87.8%, sep-ad group-89.1%).
For each of the routine antigens, seroprotection/seropositivity rates and GMCs/GMTs at Visit 4
were similar between groups in the ATP immunogenicity cohort (as well as in the TVC).
Furthermore, the LL of the 95% CI on the difference in seroprotection rates and on the GMC ratios
for each antigen were higher than the pre-defined non-inferiority criteria stated above (see two
tables below). Therefore, the study was able to meet its primary objective and demonstrate that coadministration of Rotarix with routine vaccines did not impair the immune responses to these
routine vaccine antigens.

Carcinogenicity

SAE Neoplasms
Core ISS analysis
Five Rotarix (0.01%) and 3 placebo recipients (0.01%) reported at least one SAE PT from Days 030 post-vaccination under the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified. The difference
between groups was not significantly different (RR=1.66; 95% CI: 0.32-10.69). The following PTs,
all judged not to be related to vaccination, were reported in the Rotarix group (all from Rota-023):
Ependymoma (Argentina): 12 week male, symptom onset on the day of Dose 1
Intracranial hemangioma (Peru): 6 week male, symptom onset 16 days post-Dose 1,
Leukemia (Nicaragua): 7 week male, symptom onset 16 days post-Dose 1
Neuroblastoma (Mexico): 14 week male, 8 days post-Dose 2
Testicular neoplasm (Venezuela): 14 week male, days post-Dose 2
Eight Rotarix (0.02%) and 9 placebo recipients (0.03%) reported at least one SAE PT regardless of
time-to-onset under the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified. The difference
between groups was not statistically significant (RR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.28-2.50). Besides the 5 PTs

245

listed above that occurred from Days 0-30, 3 other PTs, all occurring post-Dose 2 and judged not to
be related to vaccination, were reported in the Rotarix group:
Chronic myeloid leukemia (Rota-007, Singapore): 16 month male, 365 days
Myelodysplastic syndrome (Rota-023, Argentina): 21 month female, 546 days
Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (Rota-036, Finland): 20 month male, 451 days
Supplementary ISS analysis
Only one SAE PT was reported during the course of the studies under the SOC Neoplasms benign,
malignant and unspecified:

10.4.10 Assessment of Effect on Growth
Height and weight
Height (cm) and weight (kg) measurements were recorded at each study visit in Rota-005, Rota006, Rota-007, and Rota-014. In each study, height and weight increases between visits were
similar between Rotarix and placebo groups.
10.4.11 Overdosage Exposure
Overdosage was not reported in any of the BLA studies. In addition, no reports of Rotarix
overdosage were reported in the PSUR.
10.4.12 Person-to-Person Transmission, Shedding
RV antigen shedding post-vaccination
RV shedding in stools was evaluated at predetermined time points in Rota-005, Rota-006 (subset),
Rota-007 (subset; planned total of 200 subjects), Rota-014 (subset; planned subset of 150
subjects), Rota-033 (subset; planned total of 50 subjects), Rota-039, and Rota-048. RV shedding in
Rota-006 was in section 8.1.4. RV shedding was measured as part of vaccine-take evaluation in
Rota-005 (co-primary endpoint), Rota-007 (secondary immunogenicity endpoint), Rota-014
(secondary endpoint), Rota-033 (secondary endpoint), Rota-039 (primary endpoint), and Rota-048
(primary endpoint). In addition, assessment of RV shedding was a secondary endpoint in Rota-014,
Rota-033, and Rota-039.
In all studies, stool sample collections were conducted primarily on Day 7 after each dose and
tested using an ELISA assay at the laboratory of Dr. R. Ward (Children’s Hospital Medical Centre,
Cincinnati, US). Stool collection time points for individual studies were as follows:
Rota-005: pre-Dose 1, pre-Dose 2 (60 days post-Dose 1), Day 7 post-dose
Rota-006: pre-Dose 1, pre-Dose 2 (60 days post-Dose 1), Day 7 post-dose
Rota-007: pre-Dose 1, pre-Dose 2 (30 days post-Dose 1), Day 7 and Day 15 post-dose
Rota-014: pre-Dose 1, pre-Dose 2 (30 days post-Dose 1), Day 7 post-dose
Rota-033: pre-Dose 1, Days 3/7/10/15/30/45/60 post-dose
Rota-039: pre-Dose 1, pre-Dose 2 (60 days post-Dose 1), Day 7 and Day 15 post-dose
Rota-048: pre-Dose 1, pre-Dose 2 (30 days post-Dose 1), Day 7 and Day 15 post-dose
Any RV antigen detected in non-diarrheal stool samples was assumed to be vaccine strain. In Rota005, RV detected in stools during the RV season was further analyzed by RT-PCR for G type, and
by sequence analysis to distinguish G1 vaccine type RV from G1 wild-type RV.
Any RV antigen detected in diarrheal stool samples was also analyzed by RT-PCR to determine G
type at the laboratory of ----------------- (Finland) or GSK’s laboratory. Any G1 RV detected was
further evaluated by gene sequencing at GSK’s laboratory in Belgium (Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota007, Rota-014) or Delft Diagnostic Laboratory in the Netherlands (Rota-033, Rota-039, Rota-048) to
distinguish wild-type from vaccine strain.
Post-Dose 1 RV shedding – Rotarix groups
In each study, the percentages of subjects who shed vaccine RV strain on Day 7 post-Dose 1 were:
Rota-005: 47.5% (105.6 group), 54.6% (106.8 group)

247

Rota-006: 36.2% (105.3 group), 35.2% (105.6 group), 44.1% (106.6 group)
Rota-007: 78.8% (105.3 group), 76.2% (105.6 group), 80.0% (106.6 group)
Rota-014: 11.4% (105.6 group + OPV), 17.5% (105.6 group + IPV)
Rota-033: 50.0% (106.5 group – pooled lots)
Rota-039: 55.6% (106.5 group)
Rota-048: 58.5% (106.5 group)
In studies with shedding data at Day 15, the percentages of subjects who shed RV ranged from
19.2% (Rota-033) to 64.1% (Rota-007,106.6 group). At Day 30, the percentages ranged from 0%
(Rota-014 – both groups, Rota-033) to 24.3% (Rota-007,106.6 group). At Day 60, between 0%
(Rota-006, 105.3 and 105.6 groups) and 1.1% (Rota-006, 106.6 group) of subjects shed RV.
In each study, which had at least 2 time points, peak RV shedding occurred at Day 7 in all groups.
Higher shedding rates at Days 7, 15, and 30 in all Rotarix groups from Rota-007 compared to other
studies may be related to either a population effect (Singapore, mostly Asian) or older age at Dose
1 (mean age=13.3 weeks) where maternal antibodies may have already declined.
Reviewer Note: Acceptable ranges of post-dose collection days for the Day 7 post-Dose 1 time
point varied from study to study (Rota-005: Days 1-31; Rota-006 & Rota-048: Days 6-10; Rota-007:
Days 7-10; Rota-014 & Rota-033: Days 6-8; Rota-039: Days 5-9). In Rota-005, the reviewer
obtained 50% (75/150) and 54% (75/139) shedding rates for the 105.6 and 106.8 groups,
respectively, from Days 6-8 post-Dose 1. In addition, 25.0% (1/4) of subjects in the 105.6 group and
66.7% 1 (2/3) of subjects in the 106.8 group shed RV from Days 11-15.
Post-Dose 2 RV shedding – Rotarix groups
For each study, the percentages of subjects who shed vaccine RV strain on Day 7 post-Dose 2 are
given below. The percentage of shedders in each group is lower than on Day 7 post-Dose 1, with
the exception of the 105.6 group in Rota-014.
Rota-005: 15.6% (105.6 group – Day 10), 15.3% (106.8 group)
Rota-006: 11.5% (105.3 group), 21.3% (105.6 group), 16.5% (106.6 group)
Rota-007: 28.6% (105.3 group), 18.9% (105.6 group), 18.4% (106.6 group)
Rota-014: 13.9% (105.6 group + OPV), 7.7% (105.6 group + IPV)
Rota-033: 4.2% (106.5 group – pooled lots)
Rota-039: 10.1% (106.5 group)
Rota-048: 12.9% (106.5 group)
In studies with shedding data at Day 15, the percentages of subjects who shed RV ranged from 0%
(Rota-033) to 16.2% (Rota-007,106.6 group). Shedding data at Days, 30, 45, and 60, available only
for Rota-033, demonstrated 0% shedding at these time points.
In each study, which had at least 2 time points, peak RV shedding occurred at Day 7 in all groups.
Reviewer Note: In Rota-005, the acceptable range of collection days for the Day 7 post-Dose 2 time
point was 1 to 25 days. From Days 6-8 post-Dose 2, shedding rates were 16.5% (20/121) and 15.3%
(17/111) for the 105.6 and 106.8 groups, respectively. Shedding rates from Days 11-15 post-Dose 2 were
25.0% (2/8) in the 105.6 group and 0% (0/4) in the 106.8 group. One subject in the 106.8 group shed RV
on Day 25
RV shedding and GE symptoms
Previous reviews of solicited AEs post-vaccination have shown that rates of diarrhea and vomiting
were similar between Rotarix groups and placebo, including rates of diarrhea and vomiting from

248

Rota-007. This indicates that RV shedding is not associated with an increase in GE symptoms in
Rotarix recipients compared to placebo recipients.
Live RV shedding post-vaccination
Rota-039 and Rota-048
In Rota-039 and Rota-048, live RV detection was performed at GSK’s laboratory on available RV
antigen-positive stool specimens collected at Day 7 post-Dose 1. A titration assay using --------cells as substrate was performed. The percentage of live virus in all stool samples collected at Day
7 in each study were then extrapolated by multiplying the percentage of subjects with live RV
detected in RV-positive samples by the percentage of subjects with RV-positive samples.
In Rota-039, 46% (6/13) of subjects with available RV-positive samples had live RV detected in the
same stools. The overall estimated percentage of subjects with live RV in stool samples collected
on Day 7 post-Dose 1 was 25.6% (90/162 x 0.462). Similarly, in Rota-048, 45% (15/33) of subjects
with available RV-positive samples had live RV detected in those samples. The overall estimated
percentage of subjects with live RV on Day 7 post-Dose 1 samples was 26.5% (49/84 x 0.455).
Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-014, and Rota-033
Live virus detection using the same methods was also performed on 96 retained frozen stool
samples (Day 7 post-Dose 1) from these 4 studies that were RV antigen-positive by ELISA. In
parallel, 51 wild-type RV antigen-positive frozen stool samples from GE episodes in Rota-006,
Rota-007, and Rota-033 were tested for live virus.
Live RV was detected in 14.6% (14/96) of RV-positive samples. In comparison, live RV was
detected in 68.6% (35/51) of wild-type RV-positive samples from GE episodes, demonstrating
higher shedding after wild-type RV GE than after Rotarix vaccination.
RV antigen shedding – non-vaccinated subjects
Of the 421 placebo recipients in Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-014, Rota-039, and Rota-048
who had stool analysis results, 7 (Rota-005- 2, Rota-006-1, Rota-007- 3, Rota-039- 1) had stool
samples that tested positive for vaccine RV antigen. None of the 7 subjects were symptomatic with
a GE-like illness near the time of stool collection, and all were healthy. Four of the 7 seroconverted
post-Dose 2. Two of the subjects had a twin brother or sister enrolled in the Rotarix group (106.8
group) in the same study at the same time, therefore possibly leading to transmission due to close
contact. For the other 5 subjects, reasons for vaccine RV infection are not clear, although errors in
stool sample labeling could not be ruled out.
RV shedding - Non-BLA studies
Rota-045 (see section 10.4.13)
This Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the immunogenicity,
reactogenicity and safety of 2 doses of Rotarix (106.5 CCID50) in healthy infants (Bangladesh) when
co-administered with OPV versus given alone. Shedding was lower in the Rotarix + OPV group
(17.6%) compared to the Rotarix without OPV group (31.0%).

Jaundice, transaminases increased (France): 2 month male, 2 days post-Rotarix (Dose 1), resolved
Secondary transmission – July 12, 2006 to January 11, 2007
Two cases of secondary transmission were reported. In the first case, a male infant (France, age
unknown) experienced mild vomiting and moderate diarrhea 24-48 hours after Rotarix vaccination
of his brother. His symptoms resolved within 1-3 days. The etiology of the GE episode was not
determined. In the second case, a 4-month female (France) developed moderate diarrhea 2 days
post-Dose 1 of Rotarix. The etiology of this GE episode was not determined. The subject reportedly
contaminated other children in a nursery, but the etiology of GE episodes in these children was also
not determined.
Secondary transmission – January 12, 2007 to July 11, 2007
One case of possible secondary transmission was reported in an elderly female (Germany, age
unknown) who experienced vomiting and diarrhea while caring for a sick grandson who had been
recently vaccinated with Rotarix. Two days post-vaccination, the 5-month old grandson developed
suspected RV GE. The interval between exposure to grandson and illness onset in the elderly
female was unknown. Stool tests for RV were not performed.
Fatal cases – July 12, 2006 to January 11, 2007
Two fatal cases, both IS, were reported from Brazil. The first case (age and sex not known)
received an unspecified dose of Rotarix in August 2006, and developed IS after an unspecified
period of time and was hospitalized. The cause of death was also not specified, and it was unknown

252

whether an autopsy was performed. The second case, a 2 month female, received an unspecified
dose of Rotarix on September 26, 2006. She developed IS with onset 6 days post-vaccination, and
died --- days after onset. It was unknown whether an autopsy was performed.
Reviewer Note: The 3rd PSUR also contained follow-up information on 2 fatal cases that occurred
during the 2nd PSUR. The first case was a 9-month-old subject from Mexico (sex unknown) who
died following a RV infection following an unspecified time interval. However, it remains unclear
whether the subject actually received Rotarix. The second case involved a 3-month-old male from
Venezuela who developed ITP, with symptom onset 3 hours after Rotarix vaccination. The patient
also had received OPV and DTPa-HBV vaccines concomitantly.
Fatal cases – January 12, 2007 to July 11, 2007
Three fatal cases were reported. Two of the cases (Brazil, >6 weeks of age, gender unknown) died
after developing IS post-Dose 1 of Rotarix. Interval from vaccination to IS onset and death
unspecified. The third case (Kenya, 4 month male) developed profuse watery diarrhea 8 hours postDose 1 of Rotarix. He subsequently developed circulatory collapse and respiratory failure one day
later and died that same day. Stool sample was positive for adenovirus.
Maladministration – July 12, 2006 to January 11, 2007
66 cases of maladministration were reported (reporting frequency = 0.8/100,000 doses distributed).
Of the total, 46 cases were administered Rotarix via the incorrect route (IM-42, SQ-3, unknown-1)
and 20 cases received vaccine at an incorrect age or on an inappropriate schedule.
14 of the 46 cases of incorrect administration route were associated with AEs (non-SAE-14, SAE1). The lone SAE was reported as allergic shock which occurred in a 2 month old Belgian subject
30 minutes after IM administration of Rotarix. The event resolved the same day. The applicant felt
that the clinical description of the case was inconsistent with the diagnosis.
7 of the 20 cases of incorrect age/scheduling of Rotarix administration were associated with AEs
(non-SAE-3, SAE-4). All SAEs were reported as gastroenteritis (incorrect age-2, incorrect schedule2) and eventually resolved.
Maladministration – January 12, 2007 to July 11, 2007
94 cases of maladministration were reported; 61 cases were administered Rotarix via the incorrect
route and 33 cases received vaccine inappropriately for other reasons (incorrect age, inappropriate
schedule, inappropriately stored vaccine).
12 of the 61 cases of incorrect administration route were associated with AEs (non-SAE-10, SAE2). The 2 SAEs were reported as RSV pneumonia and injection site reaction; both resolved.
5 of the 33 cases of other inappropriately administered Rotarix vaccinations were associated with
AEs (non-SAE-3, SAE-2). One of the SAEs was a case of IS 5 days post-Dose 1 of Rotarix at half
of the recommended dose. The second SAE was a 19-month female who, after receiving Rotarix at
an older age than recommended, developed GE and dehydration.
Most frequent reported AEs – from launch of Rotarix to July 11, 2007

Blood in stools (PTs Haemorrhagic diarrhea, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Haematochezia)
57 cases of blood in stools (excluding those associated with IS) have been reported during this
interval (0.46/100,000 doses distributed). 63% of the reports were from developing countries.
Intussusception
140 spontaneous reports of IS were made during this interval, 61 of which occurred within 30 days
of Rotarix vaccination. The majority of the 61 cases were reported from Mexico (15), Brazil (10),
Belgium (6) and Venezuela (6). 58 of the 61 cases had sufficient information to be classified as
definite IS according to the Brighton case definition.
Based on statistical analyses described in the PSUR which used the background incidence of IS in
children <1 year of age and a figure of 12.3 million distributed doses of Rotarix, the applicant
calculated a total of 556 cases of IS that would have been expected to occur within 30 days postvaccination during this period of observation. The observed-to-expected IS case ratios for infants 23 months, 3-4 months, 4-5 months, and 5-6 months of age were 8:66, 13:41, 15:312, and 15:137,
respectively.
Analysis of the 61 IS cases by time to onset post-vaccination did not reveal any clustering of cases
after Dose 1, Dose 2, or unspecified dose number.
Kawasaki disease
No cases of Kawasaki disease have been reported.
Non-BLA studies
The following 2 non-BLA studies were completed during the period of the 3rd PSUR, neither of
which identified any new safety issues:
Rota-041
This Phase IIIB, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study evaluated the
immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of 2 doses of Rotarix in healthy 6-12 week old infants at
Dose 1. No fatal SAEs or were reported. Eleven SAEs (Rotarix-9, placebo-2) were reported, with
only one SAE, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Rotarix group; 3.5 month female; onset 33
days post-Dose 1) assessed as causally related to vaccination. No IS cases or study
discontinuations due to AEs/SAEs were reported.
Rota-045
This Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the immunogenicity,
reactogenicity and safety of 2 doses of Rotarix in healthy infants (Bangladesh) when co-administered
with OPV versus given alone. No vaccine-related SAEs were reported. Reactogenicity profiles were
similar between Rotarix and placebo groups, and between Rotarix groups.

254

Results of the following 3 non-BLA studies were summarized in the 4th PSUR, none of which
identified any new safety issues:
Rota-044
This Phase IIIB, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study evaluated the
immunogenicity and safety of 2 doses of Rotarix in India in healthy 8 week old infants at Dose 1. No
fatal SAEs or were reported. Five subjects (Rotarix-3, placebo-2) reported non-fatal SAEs, none of
which were judged to be causally related to vaccination. No IS cases were reported.
Rota-051
This Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the immunogenicity,
reactogenicity and safety of 2 doses of Rotarix in healthy infants in Vietnam. Reactogenicity profiles
were similar between treatment arms, and clinically meaningful differences in unsolicited AEs and
SAEs between groups were not observed.
Rota-061
This Phase III, randomized study evaluated the immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of 3 lots of
lyophilized Rotarix and a liquid Rotarix formulation when given as 2 doses in healthy infants. The 3
lots were similar in reactogenicity and unsolicited AE reporting. No fatal events or IS cases were
reported between Dose 1 and Visit 3.
Other non-BLA studies
In addition, a list of SAEs from other non-BLA studies (Rota-003, Rota-013, Rota-----, Rota----,
Rota-020, Rota-021, Rota-041, Rota-044, Rota-045) was submitted with the BLA. Besides the case
of vaccine-related ITP mentioned previously in Rota-041, 2 other vaccine-related SAEs in Rotarix
recipients were noted as follows:

DTPw-HBV-Hib
Intussusception (Rota-021): 6 month female, onset 15 days post-Dose 3, also received
DTPw-HBV-Hib
In addition, the following SAEs (all judged as unrelated to vaccination) associated with fatal
outcomes were reported in Rotarix recipients:

Data obtained from Analysis of Kawasaki Reports Following Rotarix, pgs 11 & 20

Among ongoing trials (as of Analysis of Kawasaki Reports Following Rotarix dated June 18, 2007),
22 cases of KD have been reported from 3 trials being conducted in Asia: Rota-028 (Singapore),
Rota-029 (Hong Kong), and Rota-030 (Taiwan). Of these 22 cases, 13 occurred in Rotarix
recipients and 9 occurred in placebo recipients; the relative risk was 1.4 (95% CI: 0.6-3.4). Eleven
of the 22 cases (Rotarix-8, placebo-3) met the criteria for KD, 9 cases (Rotarix-4, placebo-5) met
the criteria for incomplete (atypical) KD, and 2 cases (Rotarix-1, placebo-1) had insufficient
information to be categorized in either category. A summary of cases by study is presented below.

Data obtained from Analysis of Kawasaki Reports Following Rotarix, pgs 20-23

Analysis of the time to onset of the 20 cases that met the KD or incomplete KD criteria did not
reveal temporal clustering among either Rotarix subjects or all subjects. Only 2 cases had onset
within the first month post-vaccination (Rotarix case – 3 days post-Dose 1, placebo case – 14 days
post-Dose 2).
Analysis of the time to onset of all 27 reported cases from BLA (Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-023) and
non-BLA studies (Rota-028, Rota-029, Rota-030, Rota-061) similarly did not indicate temporal
clustering among Rotarix subjects or all subjects. Only 3 cases had onset within the first month
post-vaccination (Rotarix cases – 3 days post-Dose 1, 12 days post-Dose 1; placebo case – 14
days post-Dose 2).
Analyses of observed versus expected incidence of KD reports, based on published estimates of
background incidence of KD under 5 years of age in each study region (Latin American, Europe,
North America, South East Asia) demonstrated that overall, the number of observed and expected
reports were similar (18 and 18.09, respectively) in Rotarix recipients (see table below). Among
placebo recipients, the observed-to-expected ratio was 9 to 16.02; the lower number of observed
reports was driven by results from Rota-028 (4 observed versus 8.45 expected).

Ongoing targeted safety studies
The following 3 targeted safety studies are ongoing, with no results available at the time of the
submitted PSUR:
Rota-022: Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety,
reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 3 doses of Rotarix -------------- in HIV-infected infants ----------------weeks of age in South Africa.
Rota-052: Phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to explore the existence
of horizontal transmission of the Rotarix vaccine strain between twins within a family.
Rota-054: Phase IIIb, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-country, multi-center
study, to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 2 doses of Rotarix when
administered to medically stable pre-term (< 37 weeks) infants on a 0, 1- or 0, 2-month schedule.
10.5

Safety Conclusions

The available pooled safety data indicate that Rotarix, when administered at a potency of 106.5
CCID50 per dose and as a 2-dose series 1-2 months apart in healthy infants beginning 6-17 weeks
of age, demonstrated similar frequencies of solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and fatalities with
those of placebo. The exceptions were gastroenteritis and diarrhea, which were reported
significantly less as SAEs in Rotarix subjects compared to placebo subjects. Three different lots of
Rotarix also had similar safety profiles. An increased risk of IS was not observed. Co-administration
of Rotarix with routine pediatric vaccines did not impair the immune response to any of these
vaccine antigens. Although data was limited, Rotarix appeared to be safe when administered to preterm infants. Thus far, no significant post-marketing safety issues have been identified.
11

Additional Clinical Issues

11.1

Directions for Use

How Commercially Supplied
Rotarix will be supplied as a vial of lyophilized vaccine and a pre-filled oral applicator containing 1
ml of liquid CaCO3 buffer. The applicator contains a plunger stopper and a transfer adapter for
reconstitution.

258

Reconstitution
In all studies, Rotarix was prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized active ingredient (RIX4414
strain + excipients) with 1.0 ml of GSK’s CaCO3 buffer contained in a pre-filled syringe. After
injecting the buffer into the vial containing the lyophilized vaccine, the vial was shaken well to
resuspend the vaccine. The entire volume of resuspended product was then withdrawn into the
same syringe, the needle (or transfer device) of the syringe was discarded, and the product was
administered promptly as a single oral dose.
Reconstitution of the commercial lyophilized vaccine will follow the same procedures, using an oral
applicator filled with buffer and a transfer adapter instead of a syringe and needle. The reconstituted
vaccine should appear milky white in appearance. It should be inspected visually for particulate
matter and/or discoloration, and not be administered if either of these conditions exists.
Administration
Rotarix is to be administered orally. The infant should be seated in a reclining position, and the
entire content of the oral applicator containing the reconstituted vaccine should be administered on
the inside of the cheek. Rotarix is not to be administered by injection.
Storage and Handling before Reconstitution
Both the lyophilized Rotarix and buffer should be stored and transported at 36° to 46° F (+2° to +8°
C). Stability data demonstrated no loss of vaccine potency when the lyophilized vaccine and buffer
were stored at this temperature range for at least -- months. If the vaccine is frozen, it should be
discarded. The vaccine should be stored in its original package to protect from light.
Storage and Handling after Reconstitution
Rotarix should be administered promptly or stored at 36° to 46° F (+2° to +8° C) for up to 24 hours.
Stability data demonstrated no loss of potency 24 hours after reconstitution when the vaccine was
stored at this temperature range. Unused reconstituted vaccine should be discarded if not used
within 24 hours.
11.2

Dose Regimens and Administration

Level of Confidence for the Dose/Regimen
Nine of the 11 BLA studies evaluated the safety and immunogenicity, with 3 studies evaluating the
efficacy, of 2 doses of Rotarix at the proposed licensure potency of ≥ 106.0 CCID50 per dose. Eight of
the 9 studies enrolled and vaccinated subjects who were at least 6 weeks of age at Dose 1, the
proposed starting age for licensure. All studies required at least 4 weeks between doses, the
minimum proposed dosing interval for licensure. The quality of data was acceptable and consistent
for all trials, reflecting the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and conduct in each
study.
Dose-toxicity and Dose-response Relationships
As described in section 8.1.4, Rota-006 evaluated 2 doses of Rotarix administered 2 months apart
at 3 different dose potencies (105.3 CCID50, 105.6 CCID50, and 106.6 CCID50). Rota-007 also evaluated
2 doses of Rotarix administered 1 month apart at the same range of potencies as in Rota-006. In
both studies, overall, frequencies of solicited, unsolicited, and SAEs after each dose were similar
between treatment groups. Although post-Dose 1 RV shedding rates were highest in the 106.6
CCID50 group in both studies, post-Dose 2 shedding for this group was lower than the 105.6 CCID50
group in Rota-006 and lower than both the 105.3 CCID50 and 105.6 CCID50 groups in Rota-007.
In Rota-006, Year 1 VE against any RV GE was higher for the 106.6 CCID50 group than the other
lower potencies. A dose-response was observed for Year 1 VE against severe RV GE, with the
highest VE observed in the 106.6 CCID50 group. Seroconversion rates and GMC were also the
highest in the 106.6 CCID50 group, while a dose-response was seen for vaccine take rates.
In Rota-007, seroconversion rates and GMCs were the highest in the 105.6 CCID50 group, although
estimates for both parameters were similar between the 105.6 CCID50 group and
106.6 CCID50 groups.

259

Both studies indicated that a dose-response for toxicity was not observed, while the highest potency
(106.6 CCID50) provided the most optimal combination of efficacy and immunogenicity.
The length of the dosing interval (1 versus 2 months) did not affect vaccine efficacy. In both pivotal
Phase III studies (Rota-023 and Rota-036), 1 or 2 month intervals were allowed, resulting in higher
VE against any RV GE, and equivalent or higher VE against severe RV GE, than in Rota-006 (106.6
CCID50 group, 2-month interval).
Dosing interval also did not significantly affect immunogenicity. Although seroconversion rates,
GMC, and vaccine take rates were higher in Rota-007 (1-month dose interval) than in Rota-006 (2month dose interval), the differences may have been explained by an older study cohort in Rota007 (11-17 weeks at Dose 1) compared to Rota-006 (6 to 12 weeks at Dose 1) and/or ethnic
differences in these 2 studies (Asian versus Hispanic). However, when comparing Rota-007 with
Rota-039, another study utilizing a 2-month dose interval in subjects 6-12 weeks of age from
Thailand, seroconversion rates were similar between studies while GMC was higher in Rota-039
than in Rota-007. These results suggest that older age at Dose 1 and dosing interval did not
significantly affect RV immunogenicity, and that ethnicity may influence RV immune response.
Higher seroconversion rates and GMCs in Rota-036 (Europe, 1- or 2-month dose intervals) than in
Rota-023 (Latin America, 1- or 2-month dose intervals) also indicate the RV immunogenicity may be
influenced by ethnicity and/or socioeconomic factors.
Breastfeeding did not adversely impact RV immunogenicity in either study, nor did it impact efficacy
in another study (Rota-036; see section 9.1.4).
Dose Modification for Special Populations
Dose modification was not evaluated for any special pediatric population, including infants born preterm (< 36 weeks gestation) and immunocompromised infants. Studies that allowed inclusion of
pre-term infants administered Rotarix at the proposed licensure potency of ≥ 106.0 CCID50 per dose.
Unresolved Dosing/Administration Issues
No other dosing or administration issues related to this product have been identified.
11.3

Special Populations

Eight of the 9 BLA studies that evaluated Rotarix at the proposed licensure potency of ≥ 106.0
CCID50 per dose enrolled and vaccinated infants who were at least 6 weeks of age at Dose 1; only
Rota-007 required a minimum age of 8 weeks. The maximum age at Dose 1 varied between 12
weeks to 17 weeks. Of the remaining 2 BLA studies, age ranges at Dose 1 were 6-12 weeks, 5-10
weeks, and 8-17 weeks.
Gender distribution did not vary significantly across studies, and noticeable differences in the
percentages of females versus males were not observed in each study.
As mentioned previously, all studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Study
conduct and procedures, such as main inclusion and exclusion criteria, efficacy endpoint definitions,
case ascertainment, stool testing, immunogenicity testing and endpoint definitions, and safety
monitoring were similar across studies.
Rotarix was not formally evaluated in any special populations, including pre-term infants and infants
with immunodeficiencies or other chronic conditions.
Rotarix was not evaluated in pregnant or lactating females.
11.4

Pediatrics

Rotarix is indicated for infants beginning 6 weeks of age. No other pediatric issues related to this
product have been identified.

260

12

Conclusions – Overall

Rotarix, administered at a potency of 106.5 CCID50 and as a 2-dose series to healthy infants 6 to 24
weeks of age, was effective in preventing RV GE of any grade of severity and in preventing severe
RV GE caused by naturally-occurring RV strains during the first year of life. Although not evaluated
in the US, VE was observed across heterogeneous geographical populations. Protection against
any and severe RV GE was also demonstrated against circulating G1 and certain non-G1 types that
are similar in distribution in the US. Co-administration of Rotarix with other routine vaccines in the
U.S. infant immunization schedule did not cause interference of the immune response to each of
these routine antigens. Rotarix did not increase the post-vaccination risk of intussusception.
However, a statistically significant increase in pneumonia-related deaths and convulsion-related
SAEs were observed in Rotarix recipients compared to controls in Rota-023 during the postvaccination period, although the number of pneumonia-related deaths occurring within 31 days
post-vaccination were smaller.

Recommendations

13.1

Approval, Non-approval, Conditions

The reviewer recommends that Rotarix be approved for use in infants 6 to 24 weeks of age.
13.2

Recommendation on Postmarketing Actions

In Module 1.16 (Risk Management Plans), the applicant submitted a pharmacovigilance plan that is
focused on safety aspects of interest as well, information that is missing, or information requiring
additional surveillance. The plan consists of post-marketing surveillance for intussusception,
pneumonia-related mortality, and changes in RV strain distribution, as well as demonstration of
post-marketing vaccine effectiveness and genetic stability of vaccine virus. In addition, evaluation of
Rotarix vaccine virus transmission in infant twins and Rotarix safety/immunogenicity in preterm and
immunocompromised infants will be conducted through ongoing or future studies.
Intussusception
Active IS surveillance – Germany and the United Kingdom
The applicant states that it will provide support for active surveillance activities in Germany and the
United Kingdom. Each country will utilize a pediatric surveillance unit for IS surveillance: the
Erhebungseinheit for Seltene Paediatrische Erkrankungen in Deutschland (ESPED) in Germany
and the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) in the UK. ESPED conducts national-level
active surveillance on rare pediatric diseases from approximately 390 pediatric departments in
Germany. ESPED IS surveillance, co-funded with Sanofi Pasteur MSD, has been ongoing since
January 2006 and will continue through at least the end of 2008. BPSU includes 2,500 pediatricians
and covers 12.8 million children below 16 years of age. IS surveillance will be initiated by the third
quarter of 2007. For both units, IS cases will be reported to the applicant every six months and
shared with regulatory authorities. GSK plans to commit to this active IS surveillance project for 2
years, then discuss with authorities to determine whether activities need to be continued.
Through ESPED and BPSU, the applicant plans to provide reliable baseline IS data before
introduction of the vaccine to then be able to detect a significant increase in IS rate after
introduction of routine Rotarix vaccination. In the table below, the applicant provided power
calculations to be able to detect additional IS cases at various levels of vaccine coverage based on
the RotaShield attributable risk (1 case per 10,000 vaccinees), expected live birth estimates for
each country, and baseline IS rate from the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit Report (3.9 per
10,000 children).

Active and passive post-marketing IS surveillance (PASS protocol) – Mexico
In order to assess the temporal association between Rotarix vaccination and the occurrence of
definite IS at different time periods post-vaccination (Days 0-15, Days 0-30), and to estimate the
incidence of IS, active hospital surveillance (daily review of log books/clinical files) and passive IS
surveillance (database review) will be conducted in Mexico, where universal mass vaccination has
recently begun. The targeted surveillance population will be all children younger than one year of
age. IS surveillance will be conducted through the Instituto Mexicano del la Seguridad Social
(IMSS) network, which covers a population of over 40 million with a birth cohort of 575,000, and
consists of 224 IMSS health facilities with pediatric care and a comprehensive electronic data
warehouse that can readily link together hospitalization, outpatient, vaccination, and mortality data.
This Passive and Active Surveillance Systems (PASS) Protocol has been endorsed by a panel of
international experts, including 3 North American scientists, and was sent to the FDA and EMEA for
comments. A copy of the PASS protocol was also submitted with the BLA.
Reviewer Note: According to the CBER reviewer of the PASS protocol, the protocol submitted with
the BLA (dated April 2007) did not take into account comments previously made by CBER.
To assess the temporal association between Rotarix vaccination and IS, a self-controlled case series
analysis will be performed after 660 IS cases have been enrolled; the enrollment period is anticipated
to be 3 years. An interim analysis will also be performed after 360 IS cases are recruited.
Post-marketing IS surveillance – US
The applicant states that an additional post-marketing observation study in the US is not necessary
due to the robustness of surveillance activities in Europe and Mexico. The applicant proposed to
closely monitor all IS reports, and perform the following analyses in together with FDA/CDC:
-

Number of cases observed compared to expected
Distribution of time to onset
Distribution of age and dose

Cases of hematochezia will also be reviewed.
Reviewer Note: During a pre-BLA meeting with the applicant on July 17, 2006, CBER stated that a
post-marketing study must be conducted in the U.S. of sufficient size to capture IS events and for
overall safety, and should be equivalent in scale to that being conducted by Merck for Rotateq®.
The applicant subsequently agreed to conduct a US post-licensure observational safety study, in
which safety data will be collected prospectively in a cohort of infants vaccinated in routine pediatric
health care settings. The study will have 80% power to detect a RR of IS ≥ 2.5% at a 5%
significance level. Other measured outcomes will include the following: deaths from all causes,
hospitalizations due to acute lower respiratory tract infections, convulsions, and Kawasaki disease.

262

Pneumonia-related mortality
Active and passive post-marketing pneumonia-related mortality surveillance – Mexico
In order to assess the temporal association between Rotarix vaccination and the occurrence of
pneumonia-related post-neonatal infant mortality during Days 0-30 post-vaccination, as well as to
estimate the incidence of post-neonatal lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)-related deaths,
active hospital surveillance and passive surveillance will be conducted under the PASS protocol
mentioned previously. The targeted surveillance population will be all children between 29 days-1
year of age. The following ICD-10 codes will be used to define surveillance endpoints: pneumonia,
bronchopneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, and suppurative and necrotic conditions of
the lower respiratory tract. A copy of the PASS protocol was also submitted with this BLA.
To confirm that there is no increased risk of pneumonia-related deaths post-Rotarix vaccination, a
self-controlled case series analysis will be performed after 200 pneumonia-related post-neonatal
infant deaths have been included. The enrollment period is anticipated to be 2 years.
RV strain distribution
RV strain surveillance – Europe
To confirm that the introduction of Rotarix vaccination reduces the relative detection of RV strains
for which the vaccine is effective, as well as to monitor for changes in strain distribution after
vaccine introduction, the applicant will conduct RV strain surveillance in collaboration with the
European Rotavirus Surveillance Network (ERSN). The ERSN, a laboratory surveillance system
established to detect and characterize circulating RV strains (including vaccine strain and
uncommon strains), involves the following European countries: Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The ERSN is cofunded by GSK and Sanofi Pasteur MSD, with GSK funding the first 2 years. The first ERSN
steering committee, which includes GSK, was held in February 2007. The applicant will submit
updates of ERSN findings with the PSUR every 6 months. A copy of the ERSN Protocol was
submitted with this BLA.
Vaccine effectiveness
To confirm that Rotarix vaccination is highly effective against hospitalized RV GE and against other
non-vaccine RV strains, the applicant will conduct a case-control study at a site(s) with vaccine
coverage >30% in children <1 year of age. Site selection, including evaluation of ERSN
participating sites, is currently ongoing at the time of this BLA submission.
Genetic stability of vaccine virus
To monitor for potential occurrence of post-marketing genetic drifts or shifts in the vaccine strain,
targeted sequencing of a subset of G1P8 samples from non-vaccinated individuals. The study site
selected will have >30% vaccine coverage in children <1 year of age, sufficient availability of
vaccination history data, and good RV surveillance. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. The ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RV sequencing for this study. The study will be conducted for –
------ with reports being submitted annually after study initiation.
Vaccine virus transmission
Rota-052
To further evaluate horizontal transmission of vaccine virus from Rotarix recipients to Rotarix nonrecipients, the applicant is conducting a Phase IIIb study (Rota-052) under US IND. This
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study will recruit 100 pairs of twins, with one

263

subject within each pair administered 2 doses of Rotarix and the other subject administered 2 doses
of placebo. The rate of transmission of Rotarix vaccine strain from the vaccinated twin to the
unvaccinated twin will be estimated. The study was initiated in January 2007 and results are
anticipated in early 2008. A copy of the Rota-052 protocol was submitted with this BLA.
Preterm infants
Rota-054
To further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Rotarix in preterm infants, the applicant will
conduct a Phase IIIb study in Europe (Rota-054) of 2 doses of Rotarix in preterm infants. This
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study will enroll 999 preterm infants (≤ 36 weeks
gestation) from France, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Of the total number of subjects, 80% will have
been born between 31-36 weeks gestation and 20% will have been born between 27-30 weeks
gestation. Subject recruitment was initiated in January 2007 and results are anticipated in 2008. A
copy of the Rota-054 protocol was submitted with this BLA.
Immunocompromised infants
Rota-022
To further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Rotarix in immunocompromised infants, the
applicant is conducting a Phase II study in South Africa (Rota-022) of ------ doses of Rotarix in HIVinfected infants. The target enrolment is --- children ------------------------. Subject recruitment
was initiated in January 2007 and results are anticipated in 2008. The study is anticipated to be
finalized in 2008. A copy of the Rota-022 protocol was submitted with this BLA.
Risk Minimization Action Plan (RiskMAP)
The applicant stated that a RiskMAP was not needed due to the lack of identified risks associated
with Rotarix, with the need to be re-evaluated in the event of a safety signal arising from any
ongoing clinical trials or post-licensure pharmacovigilance activities.
Reviewer Note: Pneumonia-related deaths were statistically significantly higher in the Rotarix
group compared to placebo in Rota-023, both for the PT Pneumonia and pooled PTs for
Pneumonia, Bronchopneumonia, and Pneumonia cytomegalovirus.
CBER Requirements and Recommendations on Postmarketing Actions
The clinical and post-marketing reviewers agreed on the following postmarketing requirements and
recommendations.
1. A U.S. post-licensure study must be conducted. CBER suggests that the study be observational
cohort in design and of sufficient size to detect an increased risk of intussusception of 2.5 or
greater with 80% probability. Other outcomes of this study should include Kawasaki disease,
pneumonia hospitalizations, and convulsions (within 60 days following vaccination).
2. Active surveillance studies in Germany and the United Kingdom should also include Kawasaki
disease as an outcome.
3. The PASS Study in Mexico should also include Kawasaki disease and pneumonia hospitalizations
as outcomes.

Labeling

Line-by-line modifications and comments of the draft package insert (PI) and patient package insert
(PPI) were made by CBER and forwarded to the applicant during the review cycle. Please refer to
the final PI and PPI. The PPI was not being required for a serious safety risk.

Comments and questions for the applicant

Rota-023
1. On page 118, Table 38 of the Rota-023 Visit 1-3 report, you calculated a p-value of 0.054 for the
difference between treatment groups in deaths from pooled PTs related to pneumonia (PT
Pneumonia, PT Bronchopneumonia, and PT Pneumonia cytomegalovirus). However, upon
further review of the data, CBER calculated exact p-values of 0.0345 and 0.0354 using two
different methodologies. Please explain the methodology by which you calculated your p-value
for this SAE parameter.
2. Please provide any detailed clinical information for Subject No. 38000 regarding the diagnosis
and treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if available.
Rota-004
1. In Study Rota-004, inclusion in the ATP efficacy cohort required that a subject had no RV other
than vaccine strain in stool samples collected between the day of Dose 1 and 2 weeks postDose 2. Similarly, inclusion in the ATP immunogenicity cohort required that a subject had no RV
other than vaccine strain in stool samples collected from Dose 1 until Visit 3. On page 12, Table
3 of the Rota-004 Annex Report 2, you identified one subject who experienced an RV GE
episode between Dose 1 and 2 weeks post-Dose 2 due to G1 wild type strain. However, based
on information provided in your study report and analysis datasets, this subject did not appear to
be excluded from either the ATP efficacy or immunogenicity cohorts. Please clarify.
Rota-006
1. On page 128, Table 31 of your Rota-006 Year 1 study report, you indicate that 1 placebo
recipient in the ATP immunogenicity cohort shed vaccine virus in stool collected between Day 6
to Day 10 post-Dose 2. However, on page 127, you state that “None of the placebo recipients in
the ATP immunogenicity cohort shed RV, except one subject who shed wild-type G2 RV.”
Please clarify.
2. On page 100, Supplement 31 of your Annex report for Rota-006, the second subheading “From
Dose 1 up to the end of first efficacy period” appears to be mislabeled and should be “From
Dose 1 up to the end of second efficacy period.” Please clarify.
3. On page 129, Table 33 of your Rota-006 Year 1 study report, the denominator (N) used to
calculate vaccine take after Dose 1 and after Dose 2 are described as “… or with vaccine virus
in stools collected after Visit 1 to Visit 2” and “…or with vaccine virus in stools collected after
Visit 2 to Visit 3,” respectively. This appears to be an error, as each N should include the
number of subjects with available stool results during these visit intervals and not the number of
subjects with vaccine virus detected in their stools. Similarly, on page 130, Table 34, you label N
used to calculate vaccine take on combined Doses 1 and 2 as “… or who seroconverted at Visit
2, or with vaccine virus in stools collected after Visit 1 to Visit 3.” This denominator should
instead include subjects with available antibody results at Visit 2 or available stool results
collected after Visit 1 to Visit 3. In your vaccine take rate tables in other study reports, you label
N in a similar manner. Please clarify.
4. Please provide any detailed clinical information for Subject No. 01650 regarding the diagnosis
and treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if available.
Rota-007
1. In Rota-007, please provide any detailed clinical information for Subject No. 02295 regarding
the diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if
available.

265

Rota-060
1. On pages 55 and 56 of the initial Rota-060 Study Report, you report that 417 of the 484 total
subjects completed the active phase of the study (i.e. up to Visit 6). However, on pages 30 and
31 of the Rota-060 Annex Report 1, which contained the final safety data, you report that 432 of
the 484 subjects completed the extended safety follow-up phase. Please explain why more
subjects completed the extended safety follow-up phase than the earlier active phase.
2. On page 21 of the Tabular Listing of All Clinical studies, you stated that subjects in Rota-060
were administered Rotarix at a potency of 106.5 CCID 50 per dose. However, on page 3 and
page 9 of your Rota-060 study report, you state that the vaccine composition was not less than
106.0 CCID50. Please clarify whether a potency of 10 6.5 CCID50 per dose was used in Rota-060.
Clinical Overview
1. On page 81 of the Clinical Overview, you state that the p-value of the difference between
treatment groups in deaths from pooled PTs related to pneumonia (PT Pneumonia, PT
Bronchopneumonia, and PT Pneumonia cytomegalovirus) was not statistically significant (p =
0.054). However, as previously stated above in Comment 1 under the Rota-023 section, upon
further review of the data, CBER calculated exact p-values of 0.0345 and 0.0354 using two
different methodologies. Please explain the methodology by which you calculated your p-value
for this SAE parameter.
2. On page 85, paragraph 3, you state that 6 cases of definite IS (1 – vaccine, 5-placebo) occurred
within 31 days after Dose 1, and 7 cases (2 – vaccine, 5 – placebo) occurred within the same
time period after Dose 2. These figures do not match with Table 27 on pg 84. Please clarify.
Efficacy Summary
1. On page 69 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy report, you stats that the exclusion criterion
“Previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE” was common to all studies except Rota-023. However,
this criterion was not included in the protocol for Rota-036. Please clarify.
2. On page 57 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy, you labeled Table 18 as “Anti-HRV IgA
seroconversion rates and GMCs two months after dose 2 in study Rota-007 (ATP cohort for
immunogenicity).” However, on page 107 of the Rota-007 Study Report, the same serocnversion
rates and GMCs were listed on line PII(M2) which meant “one month after the second dose of
HRV vaccine or placebo (Visit 3).” Please clarify.
3. On page 120, Table 59 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy Report, in the Rota-036 Spain
category, the numbers of subjects (N, n) for both treatment arms and seroprotection rates for the
vaccine antigens were different than corresponding figures for these same antigens in the Spain
subset in Tables 36, 38, 39, and 40 in the Rota-036 Year 1 study report. Similarly, on page 121,
Table 60 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy Report, Rota-036 Spain category, the numbers (N)
of subjects and anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN GMCs for both treatment groups were different
than corresponding figures for the same antigens in Table 37 of the Rota-036 Year 1 study report.
Please explain the reason(s) for these differences.
Safety Summary
1. On page 78 of the Summary of Clinical Safety Report under the first bullet “13 cases…,” you
state that among intussusception cases diagnosed from Day 0-Day 30, “5 cases in the placebo
group were diagnosed within 31 days after Dose 1” and “2 cases in the HRV vaccine
group…were diagnosed within 31 days after Dose 2.” However, in Table 24 on page 76 of the
same report, there were 2 cases of IS in the placebo group under the Day 0-30 post Dose 1

266

stratum and 5 cases of IS in the Rotarix group under the Day 0-30 post Dose 2 stratum. Please
clarify.
Post-Marketing Report
1. On page 20, section 6.5.2 of the Periodic Safety Update Report, you state that one of the fatal
cases was a 2-month-old female subject. However, on page 31 of your Risk Management Plan,
you refer to this case as a 2-year-old female subject. Please clarify.
Risk Management Plan
1. On page 46 of your Risk Management Plan, you state that “An additional exploratory analysis
showed no imbalance between treatment groups in terms of number of subjects hospitalized for
pneumonia during the period from 31 days before through 31 days after each vaccine dose.”
However, as explained on pages 122-123 of the Rota-023 Visit 1-3 study report, analyses were
conducted on pneumonia hospitalizations within 31 days and beyond 31 days after each dose.
Please clarify.
Kawasaki Disease Report
1. In your Analysis of Kawasaki Reports Following Rotarix, you state that one placebo recipient in
Rota-028 (Subject B0405862A) and one Rotarix recipient (Subject B0406754A) in Rota-030
lacked sufficient information to be classified either as Kawasaki disease or incomplete Kawasaki
disease. Please provide any follow-up clinical information for these subjects regarding the
diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if
available.
2. On page 16, Table 4 of the Analysis of Kawasaki Reports Following Rotarix, you included
30,638 Rotarix subjects and 30,527 placebo subjects for Rota-023. However, in the Rota-023
Visit 1-3 study report, you state that 31,673 Rotarix and 31,552 placebo subjects were enrolled
and vaccinated, and used these figures for your safety analyses. Please explain the numerical
differences between reports. Also, for each study in the Table 4, please provide the actual
numbers of subjects who received at least one dose of Rotarix and placebo, respectively.
Please also provide the actual exposure time in person-years for each treatment arm in each
study, if available.
3. Please provide information on race for each case of Kawasaki disease from Rota-028, Rota-29,
Rota-30, and Rota -061 that you reported in your Analysis. In addition, please provide the
names of any routine childhood vaccinations that were administered or co-administered, the last
dose number of these vaccines prior to disease onset, and interval between the last dose and
disease onset. For the cases from these studies that received Rotarix, please also provide the
dose potency that was administered to each of these cases.

Applicant’s responses to comments and questions in Section 14
Rota-023
1. On page 118, Table 38 of the Rota-023 Visit 1-3 report, you calculated a p-value of 0.054 for
the difference between treatment groups in deaths from pooled PTs related to pneumonia (PT
Pneumonia, PT Bronchopneumonia, and PT Pneumonia cytomegalovirus). However, upon
further review of the data, CBER calculated exact p-values of 0.0345 and 0.0354 using two
different methodologies. Please explain the methodology by which you calculated your pvalue for this SAE parameter.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “As indicated in response to Question
5, a slight difference in a p-value is possible between GSK’s and CBER’s statistical computation.
This may be related to the statistical method used for the computation. The method used in study
Rota-023 uses the same method as that proposed for the ISS and was shared with CBER during
pre-BLA discussions on the ISS analysis plan. The p-value is associated to the null hypothesis
that the relative risk equals one, and is -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. The p-value is also in line with that
provided by the ---------------------- as shown below. A possible explanation would be that the
CBER Statistician is using one-sided p-value. If this is the case, 2.5% should be considered for
statistical significance.”
2. Please provide any detailed clinical information for Subject No. 38000 regarding the diagnosis
and treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if available.
Applicant’s response: Clinical information was provided. The applicant also stated the following:
“The information available in this report does not allow a full assessment as to whether the criteria
of Kawasaki disease are met; only fever of unknown severity and duration and skin spots were
reported. The mother refused to give more information to the investigator. The clinical picture
does not suggest a case of Kawasaki disease. Moreover, considering that Kawasaki disease is
suspected to have a possible infectious etiology, a time to onset of 19 months after second
vaccination dose would not suggest a causal relationship. No etiological investigations were
reported to explain the increased transaminases and bilirubin. It is unknown how the suspected
Kawasaki disease was treated. No cardiac investigations are reported. The case was not
reviewed by an expert consultant at this time.”
Rota-004
1. In Study Rota-004, inclusion in the ATP efficacy cohort required that a subject had no RV
other than vaccine strain in stool samples collected between the day of Dose 1 and 2 weeks
post-Dose 2. Similarly, inclusion in the ATP immunogenicity cohort required that a subject had
no RV other than vaccine strain in stool samples collected from Dose 1 until Visit 3. On page
12, Table 3 of the Rota-004 Annex Report 2, you identified one subject who experienced an
RV GE episode between Dose 1 and 2 weeks post-Dose 2 due to G1 wild type strain.
However, based on information provided in your study report and analysis datasets, this
subject did not appear to be excluded from either the ATP efficacy or immunogenicity cohorts.
Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “Sequencing results were not available
at the time of study analysis and therefore it was not possible to confirm if the RV G1 type present
in the stool sample was RV wild type or vaccine strain. Before unblinding, the decision was made

278

to proceed with the analysis and study report while keeping the subjects in the ATP cohort for
efficacy and immunogenicity. This decision was taken considering that, as per randomization, a
comparable incidence of the RV wild type would have been expected for the HRV and the
placebo groups and any impact would have been in disfavour of vaccine efficacy. Based on
unblinding and subsequent sequencing, it was observed that all GE episodes were in the vaccine
group and included one wild type G1 episode. The a posteriori analysis excluding the wild type
subject gives a vaccine efficacy of 72.9% for any RV GE (95% CI = [26.8%, 90.8%]) instead of
73.0% (95% CI=[27.1%, 90.9%].)”
Rota-006
1. On page 128, Table 31 of your Rota-006 Year 1 study report, you indicate that 1 placebo
recipient in the ATP immunogenicity cohort shed vaccine virus in stool collected between Day
6 to Day 10 post-Dose 2. However, on page 127, you state that “None of the placebo
recipients in the ATP immunogenicity cohort shed RV, except one subject who shed wild-type
G2 RV.” Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “Sequencing was done post-priori for
RV shed by the placebo recipients only. The sentence on page 127 of the report is correct as it
reports the result of the sequencing done post priori for the placebo receipient who shed RV.
Table 31 was not updated as sequencing was done only for the placebo recipients.”
2. On page 100, Supplement 31 of your Annex report for Rota-006, the second subheading
“From Dose 1 up to the end of first efficacy period” appears to be mislabeled and should be
“From Dose 1 up to the end of second efficacy period.” Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “This is an error and should be ‘From
Dose 1 up to the end of second efficacy period.’”
3. On page 129, Table 33 of your Rota-006 Year 1 study report, the denominator (N) used to
calculate vaccine take after Dose 1 and after Dose 2 are described as “… or with vaccine
virus in stools collected after Visit 1 to Visit 2” and “…or with vaccine virus in stools collected
after Visit 2 to Visit 3,” respectively. This appears to be an error, as each N should include the
number of subjects with available stool results during these visit intervals and not the number
of subjects with vaccine virus detected in their stools. Similarly, on page 130, Table 34, you
label N used to calculate vaccine take on combined Doses 1 and 2 as “… or who
seroconverted at Visit 2, or with vaccine virus in stools collected after Visit 1 to Visit 3.” This
denominator should instead include subjects with available antibody results at Visit 2 or
available stool results collected after Visit 1 to Visit 3. In your vaccine take rate tables in other
study reports, you label N in a similar manner. Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: For vaccine take after dose 1, the applicant stated the following:
“Subjects without antibody result at visit 2 and with antigen negative stool samples were excluded
from the denominator. Considering that immunogenicity is more sensitive than shedding for
capturing vaccine take, including subjects without immunogenicity results and with antigen
negative stool samples for the vaccine take analysis would lead to an underestimation of the real
vaccine take. For this reason, these subjects were excluded from the analysis. The same rule was
applied for vaccine take after Dose 2.”

279

4. Please provide any detailed clinical information for Subject No. 01650 regarding the diagnosis
and treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if available.
Applicant’s response: Clinical information was provided. The applicant also stated the following:
“Conservatively, this case meets the criteria for a diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki disease:
fever (for an unknown duration), edema on hands and lower limbs, and conjunctival redness.
Moreover, considering that Kawasaki disease is suspected to have a possible infectious etiology,
a time to onset of 7 months after second vaccination dose would not suggest a causal
relationship. It is unknown how the suspected Kawasaki disease was treated. No cardiac
investigations are reported. The case was not reviewed by an expert consultant at this time.”
Rota-007
1. In Rota-007, please provide any detailed clinical information for Subject No. 02295 regarding the
diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if available.
Applicant’s response: Clinical information was provided. The applicant also stated the following:
“No details are reported that allow a full assessment upon which the reported diagnosis of
Kawasaki disease is based. No cardiac investigations are reported on this event that occurred 55
days after the 2nd dose of the rotavirus vaccine and 21 days after the 3rd dose of Infanrix-IPV/Hib
and Engerix B. The case was not reviewed by an expert consultant at this time.”
Rota-060
1. On pages 55 and 56 of the initial Rota-060 Study Report, you report that 417 of the 484 total
subjects completed the active phase of the study (i.e. up to Visit 6). However, on pages 30
and 31 of the Rota-060 Annex Report 1, which contained the final safety data, you report that
432 of the 484 subjects completed the extended safety follow-up phase. Please explain why
more subjects completed the extended safety follow-up phase than the earlier active phase.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “The reason why more subjects
completed the extended safety follow-up phase than the earlier active phase is that some
subjects who did not return to the clinic for Visit 6 (blood sample collection visit) at the end of the
active phase were able to be contacted, and provided safety information at the end of the
extended safety follow-up phase.”
2. On page 21 of the Tabular Listing of All Clinical studies, you stated that subjects in Rota-060
were administered Rotarix at a potency of 106.5 CCID 50 per dose. However, on page 3 and page
9 of your Rota-060 study report, you state that the vaccine composition was not less than 106.0
CCID50. Please clarify whether a potency of 10 6.5 CCID50 per dose was used in Rota-060.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated that in study Rota-060, the potency at release for lot
AROTA033A was 106.7 CCID50 per vial.
Clinical Overview
1. On page 81 of the Clinical Overview, you state that the p-value of the difference between
treatment groups in deaths from pooled PTs related to pneumonia (PT Pneumonia, PT
Bronchopneumonia, and PT Pneumonia cytomegalovirus) was not statistically significant (p =
0.054). However, as previously stated above in Comment 1 under the Rota-023 section, upon
further review of the data, CBER calculated exact p-values of 0.0345 and 0.0354 using two

280

different methodologies. Please explain the methodology by which you calculated your pvalue for this SAE parameter.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “A slight difference in a p-value is
possible between GSK and CBER statistical computation. This may be related to the statistical
method used for the computation. The method used in study Rota-023 uses the same method as
that proposed for the ISS and was shared with CBER during pre-BLA discussions on the ISS
analysis plan. The p-value is associated to the null hypothesis that the relative risk equals one,
and is ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Additional details are provided in the response to Question 11. In addition,
interpretation of statistical difference should be made with caution. The objective of the
exploratory safety analysis was to identify a safety signal as defined by the Council for the
International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) VI working group, i.e., a report or reports
of an event with an unknown causal relationship to treatment that is recognized as worthy of
further exploration and continued surveillance. It is recognized that the use of any method to
identify safety signals has the potential to identify a large number of events which may or may not
have a causal relationship to drug treatment due to:
• multiplicity of endpoints and time window considered,
• the power limitation (over-power to detect common clinically meaningless event and
under- power to detect rare clinically important event).
As such, the exploratory safety analysis is not intended to be definitive or conclusive with respect to
establishing causality. Safety signals identified by this method were reviewed for clinical
relevance/plausibility and followed in other studies. More specifically if the vaccine increases rate of
fatal pneumonia one would expect to also see an increase in non fatal pneumonia. This was not
apparent since, in the study pneumonia-related hospitalizations were reported by 277 (0.87%) of
subjects in the Rotarix group and 273 (0.87%) subjects in the placebo group (RR -1.01 [0.85-1.2]).”
2. On page 85, paragraph 3, you state that 6 cases of definite IS (1 – vaccine, 5-placebo)
occurred within 31 days after Dose 1, and 7 cases (2 – vaccine, 5 – placebo) occurred within
the same time period after Dose 2. These figures do not match with Table 27 on pg 84.
Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “There is an error on Page 85 of the
Clinical Overview and it should be ‘There was no temporal cluster of intussusception cases after
either dose: 1 case in the HRV vaccine group and 2 cases in the placebo group were diagnosed
within 31 days after Dose 1, and 5 cases in the HRV vaccine group and 5 cases in the placebo
group were diagnosed within 31 days after Dose 2.’”.
Efficacy Summary
1. On page 69 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy report, you stats that the exclusion criterion
“Previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE” was common to all studies except Rota-023.
However, this criterion was not included in the protocol for Rota-036. Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “This is an error on page 69 of the
Summary of Clinical Efficacy report and should be ‘Previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE was
common to all 10 studies submitted in the initial BLA except Rota-023 and Rota-036’”.

281

2. On page 57 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy, you labeled Table 18 as “Anti-HRV IgA
seroconversion rates and GMCs two months after dose 2 in study Rota-007 (ATP cohort for
immunogenicity).” However, on page 107 of the Rota-007 Study Report, the same
serocnversion rates and GMCs were listed on line PII(M2) which meant “one month after the
second dose of HRV vaccine or placebo (Visit 3).” Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “This is an error on page 57 of the
Summary of Clinical Efficacy and Table 18 should be ‘Anti-HRV IgA seroconversion rates and
GMCs one month after dose 2 in study Rota-007 (ATP cohort for immunogenicity)’”.
3. On page 120, Table 59 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy Report, in the Rota-036 Spain
category, the numbers of subjects (N, n) for both treatment arms and seroprotection rates for
the vaccine antigens were different than corresponding figures for these same antigens in the
Spain subset in Tables 36, 38, 39, and 40 in the Rota-036 Year 1 study report. Similarly, on
page 121, Table 60 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy Report, Rota-036 Spain category, the
numbers (N) of subjects and anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN GMCs for both treatment groups
were different than corresponding figures for the same antigens in Table 37 of the Rota-036
Year 1 study report. Please explain the reason(s) for these differences.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “As mentioned in the Summary of
Clinical Efficacy section 3.3.3.1: “The results of post hoc tests of the hypothesis of immunological
non-inferiority to coadministered childhood vaccine antigens post-Dose 2 from studies Rota-005
(subset from the US; 2, 4, 6 month schedule) and Rota-036 (subset from Spain; 2, 4, 6 month
schedule) are presented in this section. The analysis of immunogenicity included in Table 59 of
the Summary of Clinical Efficacy was based on post dose 2 (visit 3) results from Spain to be
compared with Rota-005 post-dose 2 results because post-dose 3 results were not obtained in
study Rota-005. In tables 38 to 40 in the Rota-036 Year 1 study report, results are presented for
post-dose 3 (visit 4 for Spain).”
Safety Summary
1. On page 78 of the Summary of Clinical Safety Report under the first bullet “13 cases…,” you state
that among intussusception cases diagnosed from Day 0-Day 30, “5 cases in the placebo group
were diagnosed within 31 days after Dose 1” and “2 cases in the HRV vaccine group…were
diagnosed within 31 days after Dose 2.” However, in Table 24 on page 76 of the same report,
there were 2 cases of IS in the placebo group under the Day 0-30 post Dose 1 stratum and 5
cases of IS in the Rotarix group under the Day 0-30 post Dose 2 stratum. Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “The data in Table 24 on page 76 of
the Summary of Clinical Safety Report is correct. There is an error on Page 78 of the Summary of
Clinical Safety Report and it should be ‘There was no temporal cluster of intussusception cases
after either dose: 1 case in the HRV vaccine group and 2 cases in the placebo group were
diagnosed within 31 days after Dose 1, and 5 cases in the HRV vaccine group and 5 cases in the
placebo group were diagnosed within 31 days after Dose 2.’”.
Post-Marketing Report
1. On page 20, section 6.5.2 of the Periodic Safety Update Report, you state that one of the fatal
cases was a 2-month-old female subject. However, on page 31 of your Risk Management
Plan, you refer to this case as a 2-year-old female subject. Please clarify.

Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “On Page 20, Section 6.5.2 of the 3rd
Periodic Safety Update Report (covering the period from 12 July 2006 to 11 January 2007), case
B0441663A is described as a 2-month-old girl. After verification of the data in the PMS database,
the case was reported in a 2-year-old girl. The information provided in the Risk Management Plan
(Section 2.2.4.2.3) is correct.”
Risk Management Plan
1. On page 46 of your Risk Management Plan, you state that “An additional exploratory analysis
showed no imbalance between treatment groups in terms of number of subjects hospitalized
for pneumonia during the period from 31 days before through 31 days after each vaccine
dose.” However, as explained on pages 122-123 of the Rota-023 Visit 1-3 study report,
analyses were conducted on pneumonia hospitalizations within 31 days and beyond 31 days
after each dose. Please clarify.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “The Company acknowledges that
there is an error on Page 46 (Section 3.1.2) of the Risk Management Plan, where it should read:
‘An additional exploratory analysis showed no imbalance between treatment groups in terms of
number of subjects hospitalized for pneumonia during the periods within 31 days and beyond 31
days after each dose’. The Company will correct this in an updated RMP.”
Kawasaki Disease Report
1. In your Analysis of Kawasaki Reports Following Rotarix, you state that one placebo recipient in
Rota-028 (Subject B0405862A) and one Rotarix recipient (Subject B0406754A) in Rota-030 lacked
sufficient information to be classified either as Kawasaki disease or incomplete Kawasaki disease.
Please provide any follow-up clinical information for these subjects regarding the diagnosis and
treatment of Kawasaki disease, including reports from expert consultants, if available.
Applicant’s response: The applicant provided clinical information on both subjects. Regarding
Subject B0405862A, the applicant stated the following: “In the initially submitted document the
data available in this report did not meet the criteria of Kawasaki disease. However, meanwhile
additional information has been received and the report now meets the criteria of incomplete
Kawasaki disease, although echography (date of testing unknown) did not show cardiac
aneurysm. The subject was treated with immunoglobulins and aspirin. The case was not reviewed
by an expert consultant at this time.”
Regarding Subject B0406754A, the applicant stated the following: “Although it is not known for
how long the fever persisted, based on the follow up information received, this case meets 4 out
of the remaining 5 criteria for Kawasaki disease. Conservatively, the case meets the diagnostic
criteria of Kawasaki disease. The subject was treated with immunoglobulins. It should be noted
however that the event occurred more than 3 months after the 2nd dose of rotavirus vaccine in an
unspecified context of positive Mycoplasma IgM and where reportedly an unspecified viral
infection was suspected. The case was not reviewed by an expert consultant at this time.”
2. On page 16, Table 4 of the Analysis of Kawasaki Reports Following Rotarix, you included
30,638 Rotarix subjects and 30,527 placebo subjects for Rota-023. However, in the Rota-023
Visit 1-3 study report, you state that 31,673 Rotarix and 31,552 placebo subjects were
enrolled and vaccinated, and used these figures for your safety analyses. Please explain the
numerical differences between reports. Also, for each study in the Table 4, please provide the

283

actual numbers of subjects who received at least one dose of Rotarix and placebo,
respectively. Please also provide the actual exposure time in person-years for each treatment
arm in each study, if available.
Applicant’s response: The applicant stated the following: “Table 4 from the “Analysis of
Kawasaki reports following Rotarix” dated June 18, 2007 (which is reproduced below, see Table
2) represents the studies per geographic area. It should be noted that for study Rota-023, the
majority of exposed subjects was from Latin-America (30,638 for Rotarix and 30,527 for placebo),
with a minority of subjects exposed from Finland (1,035 for Rotarix and 1,025 for placebo); the
latter numbers can be found in Table 4 under the subheading “Europe”. The actual number of
subjects who received at least one dose of Rotarix and placebo, as well as exposure time in
person-years, were also provided in tabular format.
3. Please provide information on race for each case of Kawasaki disease from Rota-028, Rota29, Rota-30, and Rota -061 that you reported in your Analysis. In addition, please provide the
names of any routine childhood vaccinations that were administered or co-administered, the
last dose number of these vaccines prior to disease onset, and interval between the last dose
and disease onset. For the cases from these studies that received Rotarix, please also
provide the dose potency that was administered to each of these cases.
Applicant’s response: The applicant provided the information in tabular format.
